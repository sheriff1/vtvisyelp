The atmosphere is ecclectic or tacky, depending on how you view things.  The ceilings are low and they have installed walls/booths, which make the dining areas very cozy and quiet.\n\nWe started in the bar, which was somewhat unremarkable.  Service was very prompt and cheery and prices were very reasonable.  Expect a handful of tables and a couple of TV's.  The bartender said that the prime rib was the best ever.\n\nWe were seated in a cozy booth, which may have been a little tricky to get into if you were bigger or maybe a little arthritic.  It had the red vinyl benches noted in other reviews.  The lighting isn't bright by any means and was placed low enough to be irritating.  I kept seeing bulbs as I looked down at my meal.\n\nWhen somebody brags about having the best prime rib, you need to take them up on it.  For about $30, I received a meaty, sizeable cut of prime rib, baked potato, and side salad.  The salad was again, unremarkable, and the potato and bread were just fine.  My prime rib was very pink, so much so that it looked almost uncooked to the naked eye.  I sent it back and it quickly returned a little more done, but certainly not medium rare.  I'd rate it OK overall.  The cut had the typical fatty band around a somewhat well marbled center.  It was very slow roasted, so it was very tender, but lacked any interesting or unique flavor.  If you want the best prime rib at any price, I can unconditionally recommend the New London Steakhouse near Lynchburg, which won rave reviews by some veteran business travelers and food/wine snobs.  Overall, was very prompt and courteous.\n\nI would say that the Farmhouse is an OK restaurant, but definitely overpriced.  The waitstaff wears tuxedo shirts - but the table mats are same printed paper style found at any chain restaurant.  Prices are comparable to better chains, but quality is less than I would have expected.  The menu is also what one would expect, offering several standards with one or two quasi-unique offerings.  Certainly the ambiance doesn't warrant the extra price, so I'm struggling to find the value here.  It's not bad - it's just not good enough at one thing (quality/variety/environment) to make me want to go back.  Four business travelers racked up $180 with tips, which includes a modest compliment of drinks.\n\nBeware - if you can't wait in the bar, there doesn't appear to be much of a waiting area.\n\nIn closing, the Farmhouse won't be the best or the worst meal you ever had and presents a questionable bang for the buck.  In my opinion, it needs to get cheaper or more interesting to warrant a return visit.","type":"review","user_id":"0LP2HCv1QKyNq_z4jAgzHw","votes":{"cool":0,"funny":0,"useful":0}},

The Lover and I heard about this place from his parents, whose friends talked about the brewhaus with high praises. The mouth-watering descriptions were just too hard to ignore. We HAD to go.\n\nMy first impression of the place was a little mixed. Stepping in, I found myself in two different ambiances. To my left was a typical sports bar complete with billiard tables and 'almost' rowdy college crowd. To my right, it was more of a higher end dining feel. It was confusing. The Lover also thought it was strange that it was setup as a fine dining restaurant with bbq on the menu and microbrews on tap.\n\nThe Lover thought the food was OUTSTANDING. The baby back ribs, slow-cooked smoked wings, and the sirloin steak from Bull & Bones were the best he had ever tasted. \"They also have a couple of German-influenced dishes that appealed to his appetite and were put together very well,\" the Lover added. \n\nMost of the beers at Bull & Bones are well-crafted and very tasty, except for their All-Night Light which was disappointing, to say the least. We both love coming here for their seasonal brews, most importantly. Hints of clove, banana, lemon, rye, chocolate, caramel, biscuit... you name it. In fact, We love it so much that we even got a growler so we can fill up whenever we want for a lower price.\n\nThe service was most of the time above average.

She explained that the server had just been cut so she would be taking care of us. Drinks took forever to get back and she was not at all friendly. It was very clear that we were a nuisance to her. Food took even longer than the drinks did - we had chicken and salmon. When the food did come, salmon was well undercooked. The bartender took it back and 5 minutes later came back okay. We were the only people dining now with a few at the bar. Only after waiting nearly 15 minutes after we had finished our meals did the bartender come by and collect the plates. Another 10 for the credit cards to be collected. Then she ran the same credit card twice. Needlessly to say I asked for the manager who asked me to get up and go to the bar to meet him. I explained how we were very unhappy we were and how we would like to not pay for such a horrible experience. Instead of being understanding, the manager explained that we could stiff on the service, but we still needed to pay for the food. After arguing some more, he threatened to call the police for us not paying. After realizing we really would not pay, he said \"Fine. Don't pay if you promise to never come back here.\" Trust me, no problem. \n\nDo not waste your time here.

A recent trip to 622 North tells me that, at least for now, we're still waiting.\n\nArriving at 7pm, we were seated outside on the patio - a nice place to sit overlooking Main Street, for sure.  The restaurant wasn't full at the time, and we placed orders.  After an hour, the restaurant was much fuller ... but still no meals.  We were enjoying ourselves and so the delay wasn't terribly inconvenient, but we certainly wondered what was taken so long.  The server didn't have anything to offer - they don't serve table bread, and he couldn't provide any explanation.  After TWO hours, the meals finally came, and were underwhelming at best.  Everyone's asked why we stayed so long - some within our party knew others who had helped start the restaurant, and we wanted to support that.  \n\nI've heard that they weren't prepared for the \"grand opening\" that weekend, that it was slated to be a week later, but nevertheless there are some kinks to be worked out, and a menu to be tweaked.  Here's to better reviews here on out.","type":"review","user_id":"d0M3Bx5CfuCBMx4a6yFb2w","votes":{"cool":0,"funny":0,"useful":4}},

We started with some decent calamari, which had an interesting pepper batter. I ordered a steak special, and my wife got the prime rib. Not only did my steak come exactly as ordered (Pittsburgh rare), but the waitress new exactly what I meant (Glad to not get the usual blank stare). The steak was a pretty good cut of Angus and very tender. The potato mash that came with it was a little too strongly seasoned, but otherwise tasty. My wife's prime rib looked bigger than the claimed 10oz cut, and came with easily double the amount of mash potatoes that my plate had. The meat was moist and had been seasoned with an interesting spice blend. We finished off the meal with a slice of blackout cake. It was moist, and not overly sweetened, with just a thin layer of frosting. It was good, but nothing to rave about. Actually, that pretty much sums the place up.

We had just gone by an awesome beer shop and were heading back to the ATL when we realized that we needed to stop and eat. This place appeared like a mirage in the dessert and so we stopped in before heading back to georgia.\n\nFirst off, we were a little nervous. We we the only people in here except for the folks running the joint but the chips were warm and the salsa was spicey so our fears quickly faded.\n\nI had the enchiladas supreme and was very surprised. It was excellent. Spicey and flavorful , cheesy and perfect. Everything was very fresh tasting and the service was excellent. I can't recall what pops had but he didn't complain so it must not have been bad.\n\nThe resturant was very clean and the service was fast.

I'm sure that some of the delicious sounding pizzas on the menu are good... except the one I attempted to eat with my ladyfriend.  I ordered the Bella Vista, which initially sounded interesting: \"thinly sliced potatoes topped with extra virgin olive oil, fresh garlic, fresh rosemary, coarse black pepper.\"  The order also consisted of salad and cannolis.  The salad dressing was off.  It was supposed to be balsamic vinagrette, but tasted like Kraft fat free Italian.  The pizza - which I should note doesn't have cheese (though I thought it would) - tasted like a disc of dry, hard, stale dough with no salt, oil, or other seasonings (that I could discern), no garlic (as the description stated), and the potatoes were affixed sparingly and served only to dry out the dough-disc further.\n\nNote: the cannolis were good.\n\nIt's worth mentioning, at this point, that I cannot remember the last time I complained about food.  It was not my experience with Ceritano's food as such that compelled me to write this review; rather, it was the subsequent interaction I had with the manager of the restaurant that obliged me to so write.  My ladyfriend and I couldn't even eat beyond a bite each of the entire pizza. We ended up ordering from another pizza place in town for delivery, as Ceritano's was closed by this point.  \n\nThe next day, I called the restaurant to let them know about the food we attempted to eat, and to see if I might be able to get my money back (the pizza alone was $14.95). I don't remember the name of the fellow I spoke with, but he was surely the rudest service industry worker I've had contact with in many years.  When I explained to him how we weren't able to eat the pizza, he effectively blamed me for ordering 'the wrong thing.'  I was told that the pizza was \"for vegans\" ... it \"says so on the menu\" (note: it doesn't say this anywhere on the online menu).  \"Are you a vegan?\" he asked.  \"No,\" I replied.  \"Well that's why you don't like it...\" he said.  After not listening to me tell him about his own product for several minutes, and after hearing about how this situation was entirely my fault, he finally asked \"what do you want?\" as though this was not entirely obvious by now.  He said he would make me another pizza (note: this conversation is taking place the day after the incident, since the restaurant was closed by the time we ate), but I wasn't interested in this since we had already ordered a pizza from another restaurant the night before.  I asked if it would be possible to get a coupon, credit, or anything that we could use at a later time and he said 'no'.  The last thing he did was ridicule me for having to discuss the matter further with my ladyfriend.  Suffice it to say, because of this, we'll not be going back; and further, we encourage others not to patronize this restaurant.","type":"review","user_id":"rfRBWLSbm7DHShjQTKk3ug","votes":{"cool":0,"funny":1,"useful":1}},

Drum roll......\n\nThis time, we were joined by some of our awesome friends. And from last time's experience, we weren't expecting a lot. Well, we were definitely proven wrong. Cabo fired back... with authority.\n\nFor starters, our friend Kat had gotten the Veggie Roll and was kind enough to let me taste it.  One word: Glorious. It is portabella and wild mushrooms, yellow squash, zucchini, and the usual works. It was presented in sushi style (bigger portions) topped with tequila lime aioli. This was also served with salad on the side. \n\nI had requested to have a sample of their Soy Ginger Shrimp Taco and the Tavarua Tuna Taco. The soy ginger taco came with beer battered shrimps that were tossed in a soy ginger glaze, stuffed with cabbage, tomato, avocado, monterey jack and cheddar cheese topped altogether with sesame seeds to taste. The shrimp were juicy and plump; tasty and savory good. The Tavarua Tuna Taco was delightfully fresh; definitely not dry this time around. You can taste all the ingredients well and how they complemented each other on your palate. To pair, I had a glass of their sparkling, potable Cabo water. \n\nThe Lover is not as adventurous and as random as I am. He ordered the Carne Asada Steak Burrito again. This time it was not disappointing for he devoured that thing in 2 minutes --- the whole thing! Good? I'd say it was a lot better than the first one. (Beer pairing to be posted soon.. The Lover isn't here and I can't remember for the life of me what it was he drank that night). \n\nThe tortillas were fresh. And like last time, the masher was AMAZING.\n\nSo overall, Cabo has proven to be a respected taco joint in our book.

The eggs are never dry or clumpy, the potatoes are usually perfectly tender and crispy on the outside, and the spicing can vary from medium to salty. Other varieties such as Chappie's Choice (cheese but no salsa) are similarly excellent. The tofu scramble is another good breakfast option. It's an enormous pile of tofu baked in a barbecue-style sauce. Lunches are also very good. My standard is the tofu reuben, although the specials are usually imaginative and tasty, too.

I think the menu is great - it's SoCal-influenced fare (NOT Mexican) and is unlike anything you can find in Blacksburg or anywhere nearby.  The fish tacos are delicious, especially the BBQ Mahi tacos, as are the tuna stacks and most of the burritos (Wasabi Tuna was my favorite while I was there).  \n\nThere's only one caveat to the food, I think: it depends on who prepares your food.  This is probably true with any restaurant in a college town, but I've had some very good food here, and some food that really let me down, and I can always tell when it's someone who likes to cook and does it well, versus some schmuck just trying to make a dollar and doesn't care about the end product.  The usual giveaway: the temperature and consistency of the taco shell.  It should be warm and crispy, yet pliable.\n\nAs far as the bar is concerned, you'll probably end up drinking with a number of regulars/locals/employees.  Cabo has the best margaritas in the area, quality-wise (El Rodeo will give you the best bang for your buck with the Texas Jumbo Margarita), and if tequila is your thing, you'll be right at home.  Cabo offers every tequila available through the ABC in Virginia; last time I checked, that was 72 different tequilas.  If you finish them all (over time), you'll get your name on a plaque, and maybe even a t-shirt or something.\n\nParking can be a pain in the ass, but there is a parking garage over in Kent Square if you need a spot.  You run the risk of being towed if you park at the Bookstore across the street.  \n\nAll in all, Cabo's definitely a nice change of pace from the normal Blacksburg restaurant and bar.  I'd definitely recommend giving it a try.","type":"review","user_id":"Brzyv0JlzxG3PFMXq085KA","votes":{"cool":1,"funny":0,"useful":1}},

First impressions, I thought the place had a great location, full bar, and outdoor seating that is just lovely on a day like the day I ate there. \n\nUnfortunately, this place is just crap when it comes to service and although ingredients appear to be fresh, there is a total lack of imagination and spice. I really feel for the young college students who serve as wait staff and have to put up with a completely inept kitchen. We waited nearly an hour to receive two dishes. I really wish the food was worth the wait, calamari was sub-par and the mahi mahi burrito was drenched in a mayonnaise based sauce that smacked of laziness on the part of the cooking staff that prides itself on \"fresh ingredients\". \n\nTo make matters worse, the dinner did not sit well... so I think I am being generous giving Cabo Fish Taco two stars.

They have live music there during the week. They have a little area called the \"Champagne Room\" that's a bit more private, if you can manage to get it. Downstairs is the tavern area, where people go to have drinks and food in a more adult and casual setting. I usually go downstairs at night and upstairs during the day. They card in the tavern area later on during the night. They have a big TV downstairs where they play sports. The once smokey atmosphere is now gone as well, which is very nice.\n\nBeer and specials - They have a long list of beers to choose from and a recently opened section where they sell local microbrews. I have yet to check it out but I've heard good things.\nWeekdays 6-7pm is Hammertime where you get half off beers, on Sundays they have deals on imported beers. You can also do the \"Luck of the Draw\" where you pay a dollar for a random beer of their choosing. I've usually gotten stuff on the lower end of things, but its pretty fun to do and it's only a buck!\n\nDrinks - Their drinks are always good, not watered down and weak like in most places downtown. Definitely worth going for drinks alone.\n\nFood - Always great. I usually get the pita pizza which is a create your own pizza (you choose 3 ingredients) and is an awesome buy for around 5 bucks. They totally fill you up or make for yummy leftovers. I've also tried their sandwiches and subs, always come out good and fill you up. Their appetizers are also delicious - the hummus, spinach and artichoke dips, and their spanakopita's are great.\n\nService - The one thing they're not great at is service, although they have greatly improved since I started going there. You can expect to wait a bit, especially if you're downstairs. You can also take it upon yourself to head to the bar and order if you're feeling antsy and want your stuff sooner. Upstairs they tend to come around more often.\n\nBottom line - Definitely check them out if you're in the 'burg - it would be a sin not to!","type":"review","user_id":"-k2jA8vZus1itFdn4bh5Vw","votes":{"cool":0,"funny":1,"useful":1}},

The Firehouse brand had made a good impression on me with their subs and then their pizza adverts. Unfortunately, there were a few problems with their pizza division.\n\nFirstly, even after 35% off through the website, you end up paying more than if you call in an order for a large specialty pizza. That's just weird to me. \n\nSecondly, I was being charged $18 for a large specialty and 2 marinara. The guy taking my order was very kind though and corrected his error when I pointed out that my large specialty should only be 10.99 + 1.00 for the marinara. He quickly corrected it to 12.04. I'm not sure how the math works there but I'm pretty sure it's wrong. Anyway, from the few reviews here, it does seem like the whole pricing+ coupons thing desperately needs to be paid some attention.\n\nAnd finally...the pizza...I could have overlooked the aforementioned circumstance as my food was in fact delivered promptly and the service was courteous. However, I ordered the Firehouse Pizza and it was pretty subpar. The crust was tough and bland and the sauce wasn't flavorful at all. The toppings they used, however, seemed fresh and I appreciated that.\n\nUnfortunately, I won't be ordering here until I hear they've revamped their pizza (owners re: we want to like your pizzeria!)

Every variety of bean is charred beyond recognition... and then shamefully sold for $10+ / lb.\n\nThe service varies. There is no real separation of duties, so most of the time everyone in there is running around like a headless chicken. Some of the employees are friendly enough. This doesn't include, however, the owner himself. He generally stands behind the counter leering at customers and employees and may be most unfriendly coffee shop owner I've ever had the displeasure of dealing with.

In all honesty, i have only been to the wine bar area but the overall atmosphere is very unique to the area.  The \"house\" is divided into 3 main area's - main restaurant, wine/beer bar and a regular bar with pool tables/tv's/etc (which is seperated for noise purposes).  They have a piano player that sits in the main dining area that can also be heard in the wine bar.\nI have been to the wine bar on 2 different occasions and both have been very good experiences.  Within the wine bar, they have booths, tables as well as a few leather couches/chairs.\nThe service is very good.  The hostess was very nice and explained their layout and then took me to the requested wine bar area.  Both times i have sat in the leather sofa section.  Not only did the server check on me quite often, the hostess came by on occasion to make sure everything was all right.\nFor food, i have only had the appitizers.  I have had the spinach artichoke dip and the buffalo chicken flatbread pizza.  Both were really good and seemed very fresh.  I have seen entree's ordered within the wine bar area and they have each looked very good as well.\nThe wine list has lots of whites and reds to choose from.  The hostess mentioned that they have a few staples but they also rotate the list quite often.  The wines are priced very fair which allows you to venture out and try different styles.\nOverall, i rate this a great experience in Blacksburg.

The Mahi Mahi was very dry and the ingredients were incredibly boring. Also, romaine lettuce at a Mexican restaurant?? Just kinda weird.

After we ordered, it was about another hour before the food came, albeit the server had to admit one order did not come out because he dropped the pizza on the floor...  I realize that this is a hangout joint, but really, do you have the time to \"hangout\" there for four-five hours on a Friday night?  I'd rather be somewhere where the waiters don't constantly, clumsily bump into you and/or your chair; where the place doesn't reek like cigarette smoke; where the floors weren't so greasy that the waiters actually slipped around like a slip and slide.  This place was dark and dingy.  If that is \"adult,\" I'd rather go to any of the other many restaurants lining that same road.  \n\nThe food - wasn't much better than the ambience of the place.  I got the \"Mad Greek.\"  I wonder if it would be better if it were the \"Happy Greek.\"  The meat (all 3 thin slices) was extremely dry; the yogurt sauce was like tart mayonnaise water, and everything else was basically filler to make you feel like you got your money's worth.  Two surprising notes, which saved this place form the one star - the bread for the sandwich was good.  Good yeast was used in the preparation and it was very moist on the inside and light and crunchy on the outside.  Another thing, the bathroom was extremely clean, although you notice that there is only a door vent that goes straight back into the main dining area....","type":"review","user_id":"uLthrQwJFUYvfNzsB45iHA","votes":{"cool":0,"funny":0,"useful":0}},

We were visiting from California, and even though the BF hasn't lived in Virginia for over a year, he still recalled Mamma Concetta's pizza as being the best in town.  \n\nThe pizza is definitely the star of the lunch buffet, and the appetizers, salad, and pasta are merely the supporting cast members.  Selections on the lunch buffet change daily, and there is quick turnover on the buffet, so the food is always fresh.  \n\nThe pizza is a thin crust, New York style pie that holds up quite nicely even though it's on a buffet and under the heat lamps.  The pizza really is excellent- nice and chewy, quite savory.  The salad bar is adequate; the iceberg lettuce is rather un-spectacular, but the homemade Italian dressing and homemade sun dried tomato dressings are pretty good.  As for pasta, the buffet included a spaghetti with garlic and oil, cheese tortellini with alfredo sauce, meatballs, and chicken cacciatore.  The pasta was okay, but probably something that you could cook for yourself at home.  The buffet also includes garlic knots, which might be reason enough to eat at the restaurant, and chicken wings.  \n\nThe service was quick and friendly, and the restaurant has a nice ambiance.  Mamma Concetta's is good for a quick lunch, but I would also come here for dinner.  This is a great place to go for a date, to celebrate a special event, and of course, just for a nice meal.","type":"review","user_id":"KWOCYB_578WN5AW1xPzOTw","votes":{"cool":0,"funny":0,"useful":3}},

Typically, this is not a good thing as restaurants that offer different ethnic cuisines (Chinese, Japanese, Thai and a little Korean in China Inn's case) rarely ever do any of them even remotely well. BUT this is a welcome addition to the restaurants in Blacksburg since there's little variety in dining compared to other, more busy college towns.\n\nI ordered delivery from them today, and got the shrimp and vegetable tempura appetizer, the teriyaki chicken, and the pan-fried gyoza. Everything was decent and tasted fine. The tempura and gyoza was soggy but this had probably a lot to do with the fact it was delivery. The chicken teriyaki tasted all right, if a little dry. But it had a teriyaki flavor to it, and it was completely edible and even a little enjoyable- I liked the abundance of onions and broccoli that gave the dish a little more of a kick.\n\nStill, my standards for Blacksburg restaurants is that if it's not bland, if it at least tries to approximate the basic flavors of the cuisine they're trying to mimic (Boudreaux's for cajun fare has failed at this many, many times), I'm happy. Do I still miss restaurants back home in California? Yup. Can I survive here if I have a place like China Inn to order delivery from? Sure.

Also, they run out of the fresh squeezed orange juice pretty fast during a weekend morning.  On top of that, it's a small place, so you might have to wait a little while for a table.  Luckily, the food is usually worth waiting for. \n\nThe food is fresh... most breakfast dishes are served with their form of potatoes (kind of spicy home fries that are super yummy) and a biscuit (much to my horror because I hate biscuits).  I know people that would kill for the french toast (made with either baguette or whole grain bread) but I prefer their omelets.  They are made with three eggs and automatically come with white cheddar on them.  Yesterday, I had what sounds like a dangerous combination but turned out to be the best omelet I've ever eaten: feta, fresh spinach, artichoke hearts, and smoked salmon.\n\nThey also own Bollo's coffee shop, around the corner, and the two share a bakery.

It was delicious!\n\nI had the Chicken Tandoori Tikka.  At first I was skeptical cause the description said something about yogurt in the sauce and I thought that would've been a weird combination, but it was DELICIOUS!  The chicken was still sizzling hot when it got to me and the veggies were a nice touch too.  The sauce made everything ten times better. \n\nI also tried the Chicken Curry along with the side Naan bread, too.  The Chicken Curry was very flavorful, however, I do recommend more rice because it was a bit spicy!  The Naan bread was delicious.  It had a light taste and was a little bit crispy.\n\nThe staff was really nice.  One of the waiters thought I was Indian, but I told him that I was Filipina, and then he said a couple words in Tagalog (Philippine dialect) to me.  I thought that was pretty cool.\n\nIn addition, for dinner, they had some musicians that played some pretty good tunes that sounded beautiful.  I guess it was a good \"date\" atmosphere. \n\nI definitely recommend this place if you're ever in the area and want to try some Indian food.","type":"review","user_id":"eN00PkgPgiw5vcdP44JRIQ","votes":{"cool":0,"funny":0,"useful":0}},

Their rolls are not very creative (very standard and not enough specials) but they are consistently fresh enough and of quality.  I travel all the time, have eaten enough sushi in both japan and every major city in the us to know what great sushi can be- this isn't that- buy it is a few notches above anything in a 20 mile radius of Blacksburg -  if you care about non-questionable hamachi, tuna, salmon, albacore, etc. That said, in the last few years since the owners brother left the sushi bar,  portions, quality, and creativity have gone down substantially - but it still gets best in the area for consistent fish quality. I have eaten here about 50 times since they opened.\n     I have  tried my best to eat what they call sushi at the more recent local contenders in Blacksburg and it is usually a disappointing experience.  \nAlso - their ginger dressing is excellent and should be bottled and sold.  Does it deserve 5 stars for just the sushi bar?  In the context of the area and the options - yes.  As far as the steak-house - good to take a kid for a birthday party or whatever else you do with that.","type":"review","user_id":"xvNKDmm9Pc7OLtuoxEZcVA","votes":{"cool":0,"funny":0,"useful":0}},

I love their corn salsa which they bring you with tortilla chips. \n\nThey also have this amazing crap and shrimp dip.  This dip is very flavorful.  The best part of this dip though is the pita chips.  I'm pretty sure they fry them.  They then dust cheese on them.  This appetizer is super good and is sure to be a table hit.\nTheir crab and shrimp cakes are also good.  They have very little filler.  These are grilled and not fried which is the way I love them.  They're topped with a spicy aioli which is a sort of a creamy southwestern sauce.  I always get them with the mexi slaw.\nTheir best dish though is the rasta pasta.  It's sort of a spin on alfredo pasta.  It has a pineapple cream sauce with bowtie pasta.  The sauce is awesome.  It also has shrimp and chicken, which are both sort of spicy but so good.\n\nThey have these ridiculous cheap and oh so good margaritas.  The workman's and el cheapo.  Yummy.\n\nNow here's why I took away a star.  It seem like about 1/4 of the time I go in there with just my husband, we get horrible service because they have these big tables.  I guess these waiters just assume because there's only 2 of us, the tip isn't worth caring about.\n\nSummary: This is great mexi-cali food, cheap alcohol, typically good service.  Great for celebrating anything with parents if they're in town visiting, especially if your parents love margaritas.","type":"review","user_id":"YXiToBAhXFXV-kpeV81qkA","votes":{"cool":0,"funny":0,"useful":0}},

Finally an Italian restaurant that doesn't charge an insane amount for pasta.  The thing I hate about restaurants like olive garden is that they charge you around 12 dollars for a plate of spaghetti.  Meanwhile I can stroll into walmart and purchase a large box of spaghetti and enough sauce to feed 8 people for the amount you pay for one dish at Olive Garden.  With Fazoli's you don't end up paying an arm and a leg for a plate of spaghetti.  Most of their dishes are about 5 dollars and they come with unlimited bread sticks.
