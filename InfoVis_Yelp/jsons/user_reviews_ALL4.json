And one dude who sat diagonal from me and wouldn't stop scratching his \"junk\". This seems to make up much of the clientele at Flat Top Johnny's. \n\nNot that this is a bad thing. In fact, these are very likely the type of people who want a pool hall that feels safe, friendly, and inclusive. And I include myself in that very broad category. \n\nI didn't play any pool when I came in, but the facilities appeared well maintained. I came in for dinner, the place was full but not crowded, and we quickly got a seat. I ordered a quesadilla and a Caesar salad, both of which were very tasty. I came in again the next night and ordered a burger, which was pretty lackluster. Bun was cold, cheese wasn't really melted. Offering chips seems like a lame cover for not having a deep fryer. \n\nHowever, I give this place 4 stars because the food and environment the first night was very good, I could see myself playing pool there at some point, and when I came in the second night, I was able to do exactly what I wanted--grab a table, order dinner and a few beers, and be left alone while I read Venus in Furs, a kinda boring, fairly weird novel about masochism in the late 19th century. I like a place where I can hang out and get my shiz done without interruption.\n\n*Quesadilla Review* I eat a lot of quesadillas, so I think they need their own review. This quesadilla was an 7.5. Maybe an 8. It was made of very shredded chicken. I liked this though, because it allowed the meat to be evenly spread throughout the quesadilla (instead of in diced chicken chunks). It was even a bit spicy, which I appreciated because many are very bland. However, spicy is not necessarily flavorful. The platter came with sour cream, guacamole, and salsa, which are staples I hate to pay extra for. Would eat again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "D-kkOr5VQhdP-FtBFJWUjQ"},

Thank you Yum Yum Cha Cafe!  Merci!\n\nI've been meaning to stop by this place many times, but opportunity never allowed.  There was actually a large UYE (Unofficial Yelp Event) half a year ago, but I couldn't make it.  I vowed to go one day.  A few days ago, when Ken W got an ROTD (Review of the Day) for the restaurant, I couldn't get Dim Sum off my mind.  I was actually shopping in the Village that same day (completely by accident...that's a lie), and as I was driving home, noticed my car had parked itself a half-block away from Yum.  By the time I came out of my trance, I was sitting at a table near the register reading newspaper articles on the wall.\n\nApparently the thirty seat restaurant is owned and run by a daughter-father team.  How awesome is that?!  Also, there are no carts that are wheeled around; you order from a menu.  They cook what you want, then bring it to your table.  No food kept warm by Sterno.  Hot, not lukewarm Dim Sum.  But most importantly, this not cooking for the masses means I can get Dim Sum any day of the week.\n\nNot to be snobbish, but disregard what most other negative reviewers say about this place because its greatness all boils down to a few simple points.  First let me just get one point out of the way, Houston's Dim Sum scene in \"New Chinatown\" is not stellar.  As Becky points out, no place I know has griddles in the carts.  Back to Yum, the Dim Sum is good; for the most part, it's made to order, so it takes a while for your order, but it tastes fresh.  If you live not so near \"New Chinatown,\" this place is convenient.  If you want Dim Sum at any other time than for Sunday brunch (did you just hear a number of people rolling over in their graves, as well?), here is your place.  Oh, and most importantly, if you are feeling a little peaky after shopping in the Village all day, here's a great place to grab a rather inexpensive meal.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_NH_zAXlZqfdWXgbsa_WIA"},

I had never heard of Yelp. I started using Yelp because I had just moved from Southwest Houston to North Houston and I had no clue what was out here other than the Woodlands mall and the new location of the company I work for. Ella and FM 1960? I had only heard of these places on the news usually because somebody was robbed, shot, or died from a gunshot wound because they were robbed. And now I lived out here. Where's a good sushi place? Where's a coffee shop (other than Starbuck's)? Where's Target? Where's Michael's? Where can I get banh mi? Boba tea? Where? \n\nWas Yelp helpful for this side of town? NOPE! Because all of the few Yelpers that existed in Houston only reviewed places either inside the loop or about a mile or 2 outside the loop. Damnit!!! Useless.  A few more months passed and I was getting a bit tiffed because there were still no reviews for the North side of town. So I finally wrote a review. \n\nAnd now today... I'm meeting other Yelpers for lunch bunches, Sunday brunches, and UYE's. I have yet been to an official Yelp event. Oh well. :( Someday. But at least I get to see them at other events. I met Gretchen, Shazia, Linh, and Eva L. for brunch here at Benjy's. I have yet to write a review of the places I've been for UYE's simply because it was the first time I had ever been to it. Or is it because others have already reviewed it and I need time to think about what I can possibly say that someone else hasn't already said? \n\nSo my first impression of Benjy's? Wow... it's crowded. It was Sunday and also Father's Day. Good thing Gretchen and I decided to go early. The hostess looked like she was about to burst when we told her that we needed a table for 5. But since we were about an hour early, we were just going to sit at the bar and drink a cappuccino while we waited for our food or waited for a table for 5. Whichever came first. Surprisingly, after ordering the cappuccino, our table was ready. We were seated in the Lounge area upstairs. Nice. I liked that area the best. It wasn't as noisy. \n\nI ordered French toast. Tasty. It was crunchy because it had nuts. Interesting. I never had French toast with nuts. Pine nuts? Any who it worked. It came out pretty fast too. Cappuccino and French toast came out to $20. Ouch. But they included gratuity in the total, which in my opinion is the dumbest thing a restaurant can do because those who are in or who have been in the restaurant industry will tip more than your average Joe. Sometimes even at 20% or 25%. Knocked off a star for that alone. \n\nService was good...enough. The waitresses were nice but very pretentious and they made me nervous. That's not a good thing either. I do understand that when restaurants are busy, they want people in and out. However, the larger the party, the longer they stay, the more they buy... hence, the more money they make so you need to pick on the smaller tables. Not the larger ones. \n\nI'll definitely come back here to try other things on the menu. I'll even come back with people from out of town who have never been here before. I think that's a bigger compliment to Benjy's than a 1-5 star rating system.", "type": "review", "business_id": "YDD0n84xkd_nHmkmPorG5Q"},

I can say with confidence that the burritos and sandwiches are pretty satisfying and filling, too. The burrito station is a clear knock-off of Chipotle, but I have to say that, in options and size of average burrito (maybe even taste), it rivals the popular chain restaurant. They've even got vegetarian options and wheat tortillas upon request, which is nice.\n\nAs for the market downstairs (facing the small parking lot), they've pretty much got it down to a science. Everything from Oreos, loaves of bread, fruit, dish soap, cake mix, toenail clippers, and--wait--kombucha? Over the past year, UCSD H&D have made an effort (or were they pushed by environmental student orgs?) to bring organic, fair trade, all-natural, vegetarian 'health foods' into their cafeterias and convenience stores. This is great and all, but the one major problem I have with the market, especially, is the mark-up they put on their merchandise. Everything is severely overpriced. This is a gripe I have with the university in general, though. It's as if they use the perceived disconnect between dining dollars and 'real' dollars to their advantage. And, you know, the fact that on-campus residents are forced to get on a meal plan. \n\nAnyway, that's not to say I'm not grateful that I have a choice between Cheez-Its or Annie's Organic Bunny-shaped Snack Mix, or that I can now easily clean the kombucha spill in my double with Dr. Bronner's Pure-Castille Hemp Soap.

They were clearly unprepared for the Groupon onslaught.  We went the Saturday night after the Groupon was offered on the previous Thursday.  We made reservations for 8:45 pm but did not need them.\n\nAfter we sat the apologetic server explained that they were out of quite a few things on the menu... like half the menu (no seriously half!).  Clearly management had no idea what they were in for with the groupon.\n\nEverything is very reasonably priced, I was planning to have the seoul burger but they were out, my second choice (bahn mi) was also gone.  Ended up with the chicken, which had nice sides but was cooler than I like (my dining partner's fall flatbread was piping hot... a bit too sweet for my taste).  Chicken needed salt, none on the table which is fine if food is perfectly seasoned... but risky move if not.  Was a touch dry, wish I went for the steak instead, it looked good at the table next to us.\n\nThey totally forgot to bring us our appetizer (fried pickles) but came after the meal with appropriate mea culpa. A more experienced restaurant would comp the mistake.  The fried pickles were awesome, though!  especially the pickled cucumber, the carrot and onion did not pick up the vinegar flavor as well as the cucumber.\n\nDessert was \"coffee and donuts\" delicious fried dough, the chocolate/ coffee mousse had sea salt on top (a bit too much... wish I had it for my chicken!) but a nice end to the meal.\n\nThe ambiance was fun and eclectic, vintage video games, photo booth, we stuck around for the DJ and to dance a bit.  The DJ was a bit monotonous for our tastes but the varied crowd was enjoying.\n\n\nDespite only 3 stars, I think they have a potential to be 4 or even 5, but will need to get the kinks ironed out.

The staff, atmosphere and food were fantastic.\n\nFor starters we ordered the mussels which were cooked perfectly. The flavors were delicious and the mussels were HUGE. We also ordered the boiled peanuts. I didn't know what to expect - they were soft (which I'm not used to) but I enjoyed them! A few people at the table claimed that that they \"don't like cornbread\" but really liked HM's cornbread. My husband and I love cornbread, but we were not that impressed with HM's - too greasy for me.\n\nWhen I looked at the menu online, I have to admit that I was not all that impressed, but my mom wanted to try it (not to mention she was paying). While I do love places that offer a limited menu, nothing really jumped out to me.  Since I love fish, I decided to go with the cornmeal crusted catfish over rice w/ sausage and I was SO glad to have chosen that. The flavors worked really well together. I also tried a bite of my husband's roasted chicken and was pleasantly surprised. Normally I would NEVER order chicken on a night out, but I would order that chicken in a heartbeat. My husband and I also shared a side of grits since neither one of us had ever tried grits before. Once again, I was very pleasantly surprised - the cheesiness and the crispy bacon/ham on top had us fighting for that last few bites! \nFor dessert we ordered a few plates of cookies that came with a bourbon milkshake which I am dying to recreate - it was fantastic!\n\nI loved the atmosphere here! It looks like a house on the inside and the outside. They serve water in Ball jars and they've used glasses as sconces - very unique and cute!  I would definitely recommend this restaurant, but check the menu ahead of time as it is limited and definitely make reservations. Also, it's rather small inside so it can be tough to get a table for a larger party - for a party of 7 on Saturday we had to call a few weeks in advance and we had to eat early (6pm) or late (8pm).\n\nEdit: Went here again this past weekend (12/26/09) & it is 1 of my top 3 restaurants in the area. Food, service & atmosphere are wonderful! Even if something sounds strange or interesting ORDER IT! You will not be disappointed.

China First does not pretend to be a five, four or even a three star restaurant. It is a cheap affordable Chinese food joint that caters to the college budget and does not have the pretension to claim otherwise.\n\nWhile the food is most definately not the greatest culinary achievement in the realm of Chinese food, it is nonetheless -\n\n1) Extremely affordable. The $4.35 lunch special serves eggdrop or hot and sour soup, a vegetarian egg roll, and a generous lunch portion sized entree. The dinner special is great too adding BBQ pork for only $5.99 total. All this and of course the tea is complimentary.\n\n2) Lacking in MSG! The use of MSG is perhaps the cheapest most  uncreative way to enhance flavor where little or none exists. China First uses very little if any MSG. I would know as I'm allergic to the shite and too much of it will give me major headaches and dizzy spells.\n\n3) Not nauseatingly greasy. Most cheap Chinese food places are so greasy you're arteries will be screaming at you soon after ingestion. China First's food has just the right amount of fat and grease to taste good but not make you sick. \n\nSo come on folks, if you want the best that Chinese food has to offer than most certainly don't go to China First. But if you want a decent cheap meal of tasty Chinese food that's cheaper and actually healthier than most fast-food value meals, give China First a chance.", "type": "review", "business_id": "s_TqvH0o3AQCOgTdp2rSmQ"},

Not only is their photography fantastic (just check out their blog, their work speaks for itself!) they also made the process incredibly easy from start to finish.\n\nBooking and Price - I contacted B&G about a week after we set a date for our wedding, about 9 months in advance (we got married in 2009).  Jen immediately got back to me, said that they were available and would love to shoot our destination wedding.  I then sent her a list of what I wanted included, she customized an existing package and got back to me with options in a day or two.  When I found that everything I wanted was a little over my budget, she worked with me to rearrange things and make sure that I could get what I wanted at a price I was comfortable with.  I thought that this would going to be the most stressful part of the process but Jen made it so easy.  We had them booked within the week.\n\nEngagement Photo Shoot - My husband and I twiddled our thumbs a bit on this and had to rush to get our photos taken just two months before our wedding.  I was worried that we wouldn't have our photos in time to use at the reception but Jen and Nate reassured us that they would do their best to turn it around in time and they did!  We got to look at proofs just 2 weeks after shooting our photos. \n\nWedding Day - Jen and Nate were prompt (as usual) at our hotel room the morning of the wedding.  They caught all the right moments and I don't feel like I missed a thing in the whirlwind craziness of that day.  When we did our first look in the lobby of THEHotel (in Vegas), they did a great job using the modern architecture as accents in our photos.  They pre-scouted the hotel and knew where to set-up us for the best light and photos.  As for the actual ceremony, they had all the angles covered.  Jen shot from the perimeter and Nate somehow got all of the close-ups without getting in any of Jen's shots.  They are such pros!  The photos from the reception also turned out great.  The lighting was very dim but they managed to get wonderful photos of our families interacting, our best-people giving speeches and us laughing and enjoying ourselves.  You'd think that they'd be pooped from all the running around but no, they were up for hitting the Strip after the reception to take more photos.\n\nDay After Photo Shoot - Since we had a destination wedding, we thought it would be nice do get all dressed up and shoot some photos out in the desert (Red Rock Canyon) in a retro car.  We had the top down in the convertible and had a blast shooting photos in front of the car, on top of the car and even while we driving car (driving slowly and definitely not on the road).  When the sun started setting, they even whipped out their lights to make sure that we had enough light.  We were stoked, that they lugged them all the way from Los Angeles for us.  \n\nWedding Album - Jen did a fantastic job with this.  She knew that I was looking for something specific and she hit the nail right on the head!  The only revisions we had were swapping out photos (which we had chosen) and replacing them with ones we like better.  The album itself is so nice (love the black leather!) and especially looked great with all of the details Jen suggested.\n\nTo sum up, Jen and Nate are outstanding.  They're professional, knowledgeable and most of all, extremely talented.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them and will I'll definitely be booking them for future events.", "type": "review", "business_id": "MvnG-EQlepR7Sp3YvJyZTg"},

Its the only place in town I can go to work outside the office with a cup of latte and a hookah. This joint is great to get some serious work done during a weekday, or just chill with friends. Hookah prices are higher than normal, but I'll pay it because it's worth it. The folks here are very friendly, always refreshing the coals, always smiling and nice. Here's a tip - ask them for bubbles. You can blow bubbles with hookah smoke in them - it's a ton of fun and will get you buzzed really fast too :o)\n\n-1 star because they are working on getting their liquor license (if they don't have it already) so they can be more of a wine bar/lounge. I love that idea - except that to accommodate this, they will no longer be able to serve hookah indoors. If you want hookah, you gotta sit out back in their patio - not cool! Sacrificing their main attraction (hookah lounge) to become another wine/bar/lounge is like if an Indian restaurant started serving TexMex because the TexMex joint next door does good business. There are plenty of bars and lounges in the area - so I'm not sure why this is a good idea.\n\nIn any case, I'll continue going here for my first points above - still great people and good hookah.

Also, I'm pretty sure I picked the ultimate cookie/ice cream flavor combination on my first try. You HAVE to try peanut butter cookie with the cinnamon+caramel ice cream.

They also have salads, soups, and \"pizzettis,\" which are thin-crust pizzas.  I got the \"bronx\" panini, which was corned beef, swiss, coleslaw and thousand island dressing, but substituted out the regular coleslaw for their horseradish version.  Very flavorful with a surprising amount of kick!  I have to say that I wasn't a huge fan of their panini bread - the mouth texture of it was weirdly crumbly, even though the bread itself was plenty sturdy and held up well to my drippy coleslaw concoction.  Next time I go, I'll try either their ciabatta or their focaccia.\n\nI like that they have a \"build your own\" option; I love being able to choose *exactly* what goes into my meal.  And their toppings (of which you can choose unlimited amounts!) include more expensive options like avocado, sundried tomatoes, portobello mushrooms, artichoke hearts, and kalamata olives).  They also have nine kinds of cheese and fourteen different spreads (gimme the options, yo).\n\nUnlike some of the other reviewers, I wasn't at all offended by the price.  Most sandwiches, including the \"build your owns,\" were $6.45.  I don't think that's bad at all for a very good, high quality sandwich.\n\nThe Spicy Pickle serves beer (yes!) and the service is excellent and very cheerful.  The woman at the register waited very patiently for us while we perused their very large menu and painstakingly chose our lunch selections.  And at one point, one of the guys behind the counter was dancing around to the music (which was good, by the way).\n\nThey also have THE coolest restaurant t-shirts ever.  I love the one with the woman with the 60's haircut with the big pickle in her thought bubble.  I would totally have considered buying one if they had any in stock (they were out).\n\nBiggest drawback:  they have world's tiniest parking lot - three spaces out front plus one handicapped space.  If you don't luck into one of those, you are left to fend for street parking in the heart of West Campus - no small feat (although easier in the summer months).\n\nI just got a happy vibe from this place - and we can all use a little of that.

The salads are huge, but not as huge as the ones at Cafe Intermezzo and comparable to the ones at Sufficient Grounds. Salad choices are little limited.

He saw how disappointed I was, but didn't offer to make me a new bowl, like everyone else does when they get my order wrong. I would have taken off a star, but that was just one person. Last time I visited, a girl dumped salsa all over my food and immediately offered to make me a new one, which was very nice and expected. The portions here are the best of any Chipotle I've been to (I've been to a lot.), and the food isn't too salty. They have the best and sweetest beans and rice and give a lot of guacamole, which isn't too salty, and cheese. The rice here has been mashed too much, however, and the grains are broken and mushy sometimes.\nAlso, to use the bathroom here, you have to get the staff to unlock it for you, which is not cool.\nI am lowering my review from 4 stars to 2 because of an appalling thing that happened to me and about twelve others last time I was here. I was the next that they were SUPPOSED to serve, and had a perfect view of the disgusting lack of courtesy that happened. \nI have been to many Chipotles and have visited many of those many times. (In fact, my usual schedule involves the Northgate one every Wednesday and Friday.) I know that when an employee wants food, they get out of the kitchen and join the back of the line. That is fair.\nThe last time I was at this Chipotle, I was about to be served. However, I was cut by an employee who was in the kitchen, who leaned over the shoulder of the tortilla/beans/rice guy and ordered. That was extremely unacceptable behavior. He should have left the kitchen and gone to the back of the line like any other person. Instead, he cut over ten people from his spot in the kitchen.\n(By the way, this location is ALWAYS jam-packed. This means a long line. However, other locations have long lines too, and they move their equally long lines was faster than this location's. This place's lines are by far the slowest-moving Chipotle lines that I have been in.)\nThis is an appalling lack of courtesy and so I am giving this Chipotle 2 stars.

We're talking about the quintessential American food here, yet the SBK  and I are drawn to this charming Bistro on our weekly burger jaunt. It was an up and down experience the entire meal, good but not great burgers, very good but not excellent French Fries, and a more than awkward server than I was expecting. I guess I'm always baffled by up-selling outside of a movie theater, but if I'm in the mood for a Diet Coke with my meal, I will speak up. I was also surprised at how easily said waitress threw the kitchen staff under the bus, insisting that if we wanted to order dessert (this coming just after we ordered our entree's) we should do it quickly, since \"our kitchen is very slow.\" There were other mishaps along the way, but whatever, let's get back to the burgers.\n\nSampling both the \"Grilled French Burger\" ($14) and the \"Gourmand Sirloin Burger\" ($13) yielded similar results. Cooked fairly close to the requested medium-rare, there just wasn't a ton of flavor from the beef. I suspect the leanness of Sirloin is the culprit here, as the cut of beef is generally a good indicator of the rest of the meal. We know Sirloin is not the best choice, correct? Fat is flavor, and I want my burgers fatty, dammit, is that too much to ask for? Bacon and melted brie do their best to bump up the flavor in the Grilled French Burger, despite the bacon not being completely crispy. (is it that hard to cook bacon?) The melted brie added a wonderful touch, oozing and creamy, with just the right amount of tang needed to offset the unpronounced flavor of the burger itself. The Gourmand Burger was less successful for me, topped with a duck truffle terrine, the flavors just never came through for me. Honestly I'm not a huge terrine fan anyway, and while this was well prepared, it just has no place on a burger in my opinion. Texture is important in a meal (yes, even on a burger) so the idea of a mushy terrine on top of a burger without a crust was a minor misstep, and fancy-pants ingredients such as a duck truffle terrine have no place on my ideal burger, but the attempt and the differentiation is duly noted.\n\nThe French Fries (excuse me, \"pommes frites\") are golden and crispy, but need just a touch more of salt and are a shade above room temperature. Not bad but not fantastic, kind of like the meal as a whole. I know the French can prepare food properly, and for the most part, they do at Sandrine's Bistro. The bun, a brioche no less, works well with the burger at hand, even if the burgers seem a little on the small side. The flaws aren't major, but for an overall experience, something is lacking, which I attribute to passion. Some may say you can't taste passion on the plate, but I know I can, and while they go through the motions to cook as spot-on as they can, without the love and the dedication behind the food, it will never be all that memorable.", "type": "review", "business_id": "G0bkSEyElXerSXNy6P8BNQ"},

You can order the exact same dish in each region and get a completely different experience.  For example, lobster sauce in the North is a brown sauce with ground beef also added.  In the South it is a lighter, white sauce with more veggies & no ground beef.  Also, what is it with serving rolls with chinese food?!?   \n\nBut I digress.  My point being that I have yet to find a chinese place that I love in the Boston area after almost 10 years of trying.  Yenching comes close, though.  \n\nLike the other reviews note, the staff are ridiculously friendly, bordering on being uncomfortably so.  Don't get me wrong, I love good, friendly service, but when you literally end each sentence with  \"sir\", it is almost condescending.    \n\nThe food is pretty good, but won't bowl you over.  I am not gourmet when it comes to asian cuisine outside of sushi as I tend to stick to the americanized standards, but I enjoy it enough from here to make it my go-to when in the mood for chinese.

This great new restaurant has got it right. With plenty of space out and inside, and self-seating, the atmosphere is always semi-casual and always welcoming. After looking at the menu, we expected an average dining experience, based on the fact that the menu accentuates burgers (they call their mini-burgers SLIDERS) and salads...not our usual dining-out fare.\nHowever...the wings are the BEST WINGS we have ever had in our lives. They are not your usual buffalo-drowned bits of suspiciously massive chook, these are fine specimens of realistically-sized, expertly-cooked bird, served crispy with your choice of two sauces, (there are lots to choose...from BBQ to Thai Peanut and beyond).\nIn ordering, we found that each ordering the Slider/Salad combo worked really well, although sharing sliders and tasting different flavors also works well. There is an extensive beer/wine selection, including some fashionable Spanish options, however we seriously question a wine list without a single New Zealand option, especially in the Sauvignon Blanc section. Our favorite sliders so far have included the Buffalo Chicken, the BlackJack, the California Turkey and the Salmon, although we highly recommend asking for NO BUTTER on the buns if you are interested in 'eating lightly'. Our two salads (Goat Cheese and Spinach/Fried Chicken Salad) were both surprisingly delicious, after so many below-average iceberg salads in the mid-west.\nAll in all, we think they have found a niche targeting people who appreciate casual dining prepared exceptionally well. This is the PERFECT OPTION for those diners who want a home-town up-scale alternative to Ruby Tuesday, Steak n Shake, Fridays, or perhaps even Guido's at the same price and not at the mall!\nExpect to spend $30 on food for 2 courses for 2 people.", "type": "review", "business_id": "L2c-qKZWumCmOCR-dqBLrg"},

It was not until recently did I start hearing things about this restaurant, that it was considered one of the better Italian restaurants in Pasadena.  Of course despite all that, I never found an excuse or the company to go with me to try this place.  Until last week.\n\nCame here for a friend's birthday.  The birthday girl didn't want anything extravagant.  Just dinner with some folks.  I actually was running late, but so were they, so by the time I had gotten there (which was about an hour after the original time), they had just ordered so I wasn't too behind.\n\nI actually had just read in Pasadena Magazine the day before in their cuisine section that this place had the best frutti di mare in Pasadena.  I like seafood, so why not?\n\nThe restaurant itself is a decent size.  They have their main dining area which can probably hold about 40 or so people, an outdoor patio that can hold maybe another 15-20, and then a smaller banquet room to the left (where we were) that could maybe hold 20-30 people, depending on the arrangement, and a couple of other rooms in the back.\n\nThe food came in a good time and everybody dug in.  My friend next to me got this one pasta (not sure what it was called) that was a mix of regular fettuccine and squid ink fettuccine that was tossed in a saffron cream sauce with bay scallops that just smelled divine when it was set down.  Despite my repeated objections, my friend let me have a bite and it was AWESOME.\n\nThe frutti di mare is served with spaghetti, but I'm not a huge fan of spaghetti, so I substituted linguine.  Our server set it down and it smelled fantastic.  Mussels, clams, shrimp, and bay scallops, all of the seafood was cooked just right, the pasta was al dente, and the sauce was just right.  Portion size was a little small for the price, but this place ain't so Bucca Di Beppo or Maggiano's.  But it was good and I couldn't complain.\n\nService was very good and despite passing on dessert, our server said he wanted to do something special when he found it it was my friend's birthday.  A few minutes later, he came back with a complimentary chocolate cake with 4 other servers in tow, singing \"Happy Birthday\" in Italian as they were walking in.  It was really cool, especially because all of the servers seemed to be Mexican.\n\nas #399... this is what you would consider \"foreplay\"\n\nFin.", "type": "review", "business_id": "wlbTsPLxHom0lYdROsngsA"},

I remember exclaiming, \"Yes!  An Indian Grocer!\" and yet we've never made our way back.\n\nUntil last night, that is.  UrbanSpoon kept suggesting this place while I was shaking it last night so I figured we should try.  After having a drink with friends we headed over, arriving around 8 p.m.  The place is stocked with a great selection of everything you need to cook indian food, and includes some home items, incense, candy and frozen/refrigerated options.\n\nIn the back, cut into the wall, is an area to place your order and above it is the menu, written in chalk and clearly deliniated between veg and non-veg options.  We ordered the Saag Paneer (or Palak Paneer), medium, with rice; Lamb Curry, mild, with naan; an extra order of naan and some vegetable samoosas (or samosas).  We were able to sit at the one table (two small tables pushed together) and were brought water immediately.  The place is incredibly low key, which we enoyed.\n\nThe saag was different from what I'm used to - less creamy and had a hint of mustard seed.  It was very good and not overladen with paneer.  I think it could have been a little spicier, but my husband insisted that it was incredibly spicy.  He greatly enjoyed his lamb and especially loved the samosas.\n\nI found the samosas to be a little too sweet - the fried outer shell had taken on a sweetness much like a donut or fried dough that simply didn't work for me, although the filling was great.  The menu says it comes with both mint and tamarind chutney, they only served the tamarind (fine with me, I'm not a fan of mint!).  \n\nThe naan was perfect.  I'm glad we ordered extra.\n\nAll in all, this was a great dinner experience and I would recommend this place to anyone looking for something a little different from the Shalimar experience.  We get takeout from Shalimar a few times a month and love it, but there was something really fun about \"Foods of India\".", "type": "review", "business_id": "rVf3Kt2QpqqtaluReavP3g"},

I think this retail/ restaurant space is haunted with bad business ghosts.

The place wasn't technically busy but it was steady. \n\nLet's just get right to it shall we. My friends ordered the lobster bisque as did I, the tuna melt substituted with some type of fish other than tuna (I don't remember) and the peel and eat shrimp and raw oysters and also a catfish Po Boy. The prices aren't bad at all. Maybe $8, $10, and $20 here and there.  \n\nThe lobster bisque was tasty, and I heard from my company that the Po Boy, the shrimp, and the oysters hit the spot as well. Here are the complaints though and this is what does it for me. The service was unbelievably slow. We were sooooo thirsty. lol Out of 4 people everyone ordered the bisque and everyone ordered a meal. Only 3 people received their meal....whaaaat? Was the waiter trying to tell me something? lol I had just gotten off of work people. I was a bit hungry as well as thirsty. Once we were able to re order some drinks I politely asked when I could be expecting my food. He looked at me in a genuinely surprised way and said \"You haven't gotten it yet.\" Nope, sure haven't. He delivered the drinks and retrurned 15 minutes later to ask me if I still wanted my sandwich. Are you kidding sir? I said nah, because I had already been sitting there for an hour waiting for it, my friends had finished their meals, and everyone was pretty much ready to go. Needless to say I left starving and highly disappointed, but atleast I had the lobster bisque to tie me over while my friends enjoyed their meals. lol \n\nI'll give you another try Steam house but i'm hoping you have added on to your staff and their skills have improved.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ztY4uPNUTWMN9LT3L5mD3Q"},

The outdoor patio is cute touch for those who would like to eat outdoors on a nice day. \n\nBe forewarned, though, that on late nights and often on weekends, this place can get fairly crowded with members of the party-loving USC Greek community if that's not your scene.", "type": "review", "business_id": "xuRWwbM-qxSbDSv6Ph35Eg"},

I'll share my two cents of why i think this is a great running route and how you can make it into an even better loop than the original 2.9 miles.\n\nThis review is primarily about the 3 mile running loop around Rice U. campus but as most people know this is a world-class university with an absolutely beautiful campus.  If you haven't explored the campus I suggest taking an afternoon and walking through it. You'll be amazed at what you find.  I work closely with a number of professors at Rice and I even coached there for 4 years and all my student/athletes are awesome! \n\nThe loop.  It's mostly shaded and consists of a nicely packed dirt trail along a 2.9 mile loop surrounding the campus and has 2 water stops.  It's narrow as I mentioned and you do have to be aware of cars that are coming in and out of the many entrances to the university.  But you're running!  You should always be conscientious of what's around you.\n\nTo extend my run I sometimes add an additional 2.2 mile loop of Hermann Park which is adjacent to the Rice campus.  Cut across Sunset over the light rail and you'll find a dirt trail that goes around the Houston Zoo and around Hermann Park and the golf course.  It's a nice little jaunt that can extend your run to a nice 5-6 miler.  Finally to add a little more variety, you can also opt to divert off the Rice loop and take a quick run up the Stadium Stairs.  I love this run and in fact used to have my teams do this as dry land training during our water polo season.  I make it challenging by running up and down each main stairline then run across the football field and up and down on the opposite side so you're literally running the entire stadium.  You can't do that anywhere else in Houston!\n\nAnd finally, this is our weekly running route for our Brian O'Neill's Running Club so the next time you're out there on a Tuesday night and you get bombarbed by 100 people running at you all in the same direction, my apologies.  But we're having some serious fun so you should probably just join us anyways!\n\nRun On!", "type": "review", "business_id": "UoBqaZd-EkXpW4ovrcUGbg"},

With Central Park several avenues over, Riverside Park is like the younger stepchild of runners' paths, but I'm not sure I understand why.\n\nA) You don't risk running through gaggles of tourists and/or horse odors if you decide to run below 72nd street.\n\nB) Along with the beautiful view of the river, you can also avoid the sauna-effect that sometimes happens in Central Park because of the nice breeze that comes directly off the river.\n\nC) Whenever you've decided that you've had enough, Riverside Park offers an exit at nearly every street to head back over to Broadway. Central Park has exits and transverses at different streets, but they can be annoying to find sometimes.

You can stop reading here if you have shit to do, my review is over. Still here? Ok, so the Kitchenette delivery guy comes and he forgot my cookie (which was a few dollars) and my coffee (which was a few dollars) and I have been charged for both on the receipt. So I say, ok here's the bill plus another dollar, and have them knock off the balance of the cookie and coffee which you didn't send, and that's a great tip (maybe $5.50 on $11 principal). No big deal, anyway. The guy nodded as I explained in English, fluent Spanish, and pantomime. I also circled the missing items on the restaurant copy check. Well, he must have been Phillipe or Brazilian or deaf, because the next day I call, hey can I place an order. What's your address? _____ 111th street. The person starts cursing at me and yelling: you don't PAY FOR YOUR FOOD? I'm like wait a second, I paid. That's not what the delivery guy said. I definitely paid. He claimed I didn't pay again, and I explained that I did. Then he goes off: you tipped a QUARTER on a 3/4 mile walk in the snow? I tried to explain the deal with being billed for the coffee and undelivered cookie. But he basically continues with the indignant class warfare diatribe. ou rich boy. Bet you never worked delivery, he says. I explained that I delivered for Dominoes and in Texas, and I am totally sympathetic, and I really tipped $5 since I didn't get two (2) of my four (4) items, which is generous, considering it's nearly 50% of the value of delivered items and the order was done wrong. This doesn't calm him down at all. I've had enough. Can I talk to a manager? I AM THE MANAGER. AND YOU'RE BANNED FROM KITCHENNETE FOR LIFE. Yes, I was banned.

I work across the street so it's a great place to grab a quick lunch on a weekday.  The girls who work there are sweet, and the lunch bento boxes are the best deal.\n\nI usually order the bento with tempura shrimp (very tasty), or the sesame chicken (also good).  The box comes with your main choice, as well as salad, a wonton, edamame, rice, and 2 pieces of California roll.  I usually skip the CA roll and the edamame (not a huge fan of either) and I STILL leave full.  It's a lot of food for a great price - $7 - 9!\n\nI did try some of their rolls once.  I thought they were good, and they do have a buy 3, get one free special.  Even still, the rolls are around $12, so with the promotion they even out to about $9 each.  For $9, I'd prefer the big hearty bento box, personally.\n\nThe place is small, the soda comes in cans, and they don't take Amex, but hey, I like it anyway!  :)  The service is always speedy yet very polite, and the food has never disappointed.", "type": "review", "business_id": "o7BQ5ZQDWbplY1nKKl_FEg"},

I had never gotten a pedicure before (and only one manicure) and was a little squeamish about the idea of someone getting up close and personal with my toes but decided to see what all the fuss was about.  A friend of mine went there regularly.  \n\nThe place looked clean and the massaging chair was nice.  The technician talked me into getting a simultaneous manicure.  When I put my feet in the foot bath my skin nearly burned off!  It was REALLY hot which I guess is a good thing.  Still, I needed some convincing (OK, the technician held my feet down) to dip my feet in and keep them there.  \n\nThe manicure and pedicure were...OK, I guess.  Sorry, I don't have much to base it on since I don't get my nails done regularly.  I would've gone there again though.\n\nExcept...about a week later I noticed a cluster of 3 little dots on the bottom of my heel.  I thought it was a callous and ignored it.  But, it kept growing.  A plantar wart hurts and has little black dots inside so it couldn't be one, right? \n\nFinally, it got to the point where I thought someone was gonna call the CDC on me.  I saw a nurse who confirmed that it was a plantar wart.  A couple of months and two bottles of Dr's Scholl's wart remover later and it was finally gone.  \n\nThere is no way I could've gotten it from anywhere other than the nail salon.  I don't frequent any pools or locker rooms.  Sadly, this experience will probably prevent from getting a pedicure ever again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8W76AO7Bbn_IodoZrCoLag"},

I wanted to wait until my tattoo had full healed to write this review and I'm happy to say that it's a positive review.\n\nI was greeted immediately upon entering the shop. The receptionist was pleasant and attentive. She listened to what I was interested in getting and handed me the portfolio of the artist she felt would be best for the art I wanted. Lucky for me, it was Kelly Barr. I looked through his portfolio and recognized some of the pieces. His style definitely meshed well with what I was looking to get. The receptionist went back and spoke to Kelly to see when he would be available to consult with me and it only took about five minutes. \n\nHe was immediately into the design I wanted and knew exactly what I was talking about regarding the style I desired. He didn't take very long to draw up what I wanted and it turned out exactly as I had pictured in my head. We agreed on size, coloring, everything. We went back and he cleaned & set up his workspace. Everything was cleaned as it should be and the set-up of his gear was sanitary, which put me even more at ease.\n\nKelly let me pick the placement of the stencil and then got to work. My eyes wandered over the plethora of music memorabilia on his room's walls and some pieces piqued my interest. I've since read on a review here that Kelly isn't fond of talking while he works, but he seemed just fine to discuss music, Texas, his experience in Boston, and traveling. Now, I don't know if it's just because we had similar interests or if he was just in a talkative mood, but the conversation was fun.\n\nHe had me check the tattoo periodically as he was working, to make sure it was still to my liking. This was very appreciated. As he was doing the color, he checked to make sure I wanted certain colors in certain locations and the \"shine\" factor was acceptable (part of my request to give the object a metallic shine) and it more than met my expectations. \n\nThe pain factor was nil. Kelly wasn't heavy-handed at any point, but did go over each line multiple times. The friends who accompanied me were both shocked that I wasn't reacting to the tattoo and was smiling & laughing during my conversation with Kelly. Admittedly, I do have a high pain tolerance, but this was the least painful tattoo I've had so far.\n\nKelly didn't go over aftercare, but I'm guessing it's because we had talked about my other tattoos and he assumed I knew what to do (I did). Prior to bandaging the tattoo, he asked if he could take pictures of it. I was very pleased with the work, so I agreed. He took pictures on his iPhone and with his SLR. \n\nOverall, the experience was very positive and as stated, the tattoo is exactly as I pictured it. The red coloring is extremely bright and the blues and white are very crisp. The linework is perfect and there has been no bleeding, despite the tattoo being on thinner skin (inner forearm, near the wrist). \n\nAfter seeing the finished product, I expressed to Kelly that I was so pleased with the tattoo that I would like to incorporate it into an entire sleeve design. Now that the tattoo is completely healed and it looks as perfect as it did when it was still fresh, I feel the exact same way. I won't go anywhere other than him for that sleeve. Since I live in San Diego, traveling to Boston for multiple sessions is going to add a pretty penny to the cost of the sleeve, overall, but with Kelly's artistry it will be well worth it.\n\n[Note: The rating is for Kelly Barr only. I have not utilized Chameleon for piercing services, nor can I vouch for anyone working at Chameleon other than Kelly. I am pleased with the way the shop accommodated me, as a walk-in, and the nature of the receptionist... so for those instances, I will give a recommend. ]", "type": "review", "business_id": "0FzXdnDqbb0CRf4cYIz8hA"},

Maybe there can be a little element of alterna-scorn, but really this is one of the more welcoming tattoo/piercing parlors I've been too.

Apparently not...\nAfter I explained my situation they told me that my piercer wasn't available to talk, but he could call me in half an hour (apparently no one else at the store knows what to do when a piercing gets badly infected?). When he called me back, he dismissed my suggestion that my ear was infected, accused me of not following their advice and then told me not to take antibiotics, and just put a salt compress on my purple, seeping ear.\nI was so intimidated that I tried to do what he said, but the infection just kept getting worse, to the point that I was pretty much ordered by the doctors at work to leave work and get a prescription for antibiotics.\n\nI'm not implying that their facilities are unclean or that they caused the infection. My severe infection was an extremely rare complication of piercings (most often piercing infections are quite mild), but it's irresponsible for a store to provide a service that can have this complication and then give incorrect advice about what to do to deal with it. \nIn summary: Get your piercings at chameleon, but do your research ahead of time, because their advice can be useless or even harmful.", "type": "review", "business_id": "0FzXdnDqbb0CRf4cYIz8hA"},

Excellent food, great wine, superb service and pitch-perfect ambiance.  \n\nUpon walking into this 40-seat beauty, I feel welcome and accommodated....as though I've just entered a close friend's house.  It's never stuffy or overzealous and always surpasses my expectations.  I lived in RI for 4 years and visited this place a fair amount and I never, never, never left feeling anything less than completely enamored (and no, I wasn't drunk).  Menus change daily.... always try the specials, they are the best.  And the Bistro meals offer a ridiculous value (3 courses for 23 bucks???) Oh New Rivers how you tantalize me,  Now see, in Boston, for the same quality bistro meal, you would pay 35-39$  and you have  to deal with the horror that is parking in Boston.  Not so in Rhody where the lot behind the restaurant welcomes you happily to the tune of 5$.  \nBruce, the owner, utilizes local food products, grown and harvested responsibly, which is not only ethical, but also yields fresher, better-tasting food. And I love that they have \"half portions\" of entrees.  So if you eat like a bird (as my BF claims I do- and I deny) you don't have that diner guilt of sitting in front of a too-huge portion of whatever and thinking about Sally Struthers and the withering children you should be sponsoring in developing countries.  \n\nAlso, it should be noted that  I'm not into eating at a \"place to be seen\".

YP not only does that, they made their Cookies N Creme taste even better! The white chocolate & raspberry flavor was also very good, and they of course have all the mandatory toppings that come with any good yogurt shop.\n\nIf you want to taste REALLY good frozen yogurt, without all the snazzy decorating and down-the-nose cashiers be sure to check out Yogurt Pump.", "type": "review", "business_id": "NSmuK8KXJRm2c8e4J7u6dQ"},

What that means - your stuff will sit on the bisque shelf for weeks because others are loading their work first.  Same thing with the glaze kiln - apparently non members can pay for a full or partial kiln load so again, more waiting.  You will spend hours trying to find your stuff - and maybe you never will.  You will be lucky to get one set of pieces through the entire process for the duration of your class. Also, there are a few people that are just downright unpleasant and critical to be around - scrutinizing how you are using the facility and the level to which said use meets with their approval.  The vibe was so unpleasant that I quit my class 2 weeks early.

Maybe in warmer climates they're \"thongs\" or \"sandals,\" but in harsher climes they're more like something you wear when the bathroom is sketchy or you need to protect your feet between the hotel room and the hot tub. Podiatrists must have developed dollar-sign shaped pupils the moment this trend started. Every broken bottle or cracked sidewalk must be pure profit.\n\nSecond thing: how much hassle will people put up with to save a few bucks? Waste is one thing, but after having to stand in line for 90 minutes before a Southwest flight to save my boss $15 I realized it made more sense to pay the $15 out of pocket plus $12 for two beers at the airport bar and some free time to relax. Also, how much is the time, stress, and gas worth to hit the exurban mega store? A fair accounting probably suggests you buy from your neighbors even before you consider the contribution of local business to property values.\n\nWhich is why I go to Bill's first when I need shoes.\n\nThey stock a huge selection of sensible, stylish, sturdy, supportive and/or specialized shoes. Perhaps not everything in a Mega Mart sense, but more than you'll find in the bins at Shoe Pavilion. Everything from hipster to hiker to traditional dress styles. Many items are on sale frequently, so you're not paying full MSRP. But the selection reeks of quality, value, and healthy walking.\n\nBut what really counts is the service. When you walk in, you don't fear the \"can I help you with anything?\" It actually means something. Mellow, friendly guys help you try on shoes, recommending sizes and styles, passing on good information about each make and model, and never engaging in a hard sell.

I also chose to have it made in a French press, bringing the total for my cup (I think it was 12 oz) to about $7. That's some pricey coffee. It said on the menu that this particular coffee had been flown in rather than driven, as most of their coffees are, to preserve its freshness (I mean, obviously you can't drive here from Ethiopia, but you know, part of the trip that they would normally drive). I assume this added to the price of my coffee. I appreciate freshness, but that's a super-unenvironmentally friendly way of doing business. I realize that I'm the one who chose to buy the Ethiopean coffee rather than, say, the closer Costa Rican, but what can I say, African coffees are my favorite. Well anyway...being made in a French press, these things take time, so we were in there for about 10 minutes altogether, with no waiting in line. I like that you can choose from three methods of brewing, and that each cup is hand-brewed. I like that they seem to know what they're doing. I like that they hand-stamp their eco-friendly cups. I don't like that they have no tables and don't accept credit cards, but those things will be fixed soon, they're brand-new right now. As far as would I go here frequently? Probably not. That's just wayyy too expensive. And the coffee was good, but not better than other places I've been that have good coffee for like $4 (I really mean \"good coffee\"-not talking about chains here).

As we ordered the cashier told us that the order had to be to-go because they close up their seating area inside and outside 40 minutes before they close everyday. Really? 40 minutes? \n\nI explained to him that we would be done in 10-15 minutes and that we couldn't really take it to go. He didn't care. We walked out, went down the street and ate at another restaurant. As we walked back since our car was parked in front of the Mediterranean Cafe, we saw that others were still eating outside on the patio and this was around 6:50pm. This got me thinking, was it because my partner and I are an interracial couple? Was it due to the fact that this restaurant makes so much money that they didn't give a damn about customer service?

The pizza was ready in less than 15 minutes, and I ate it after I got home, another 15 minutes later.  By then, the blobs of mozzarella on the margherita half were already congealed and kind of rubbery, and the middle of the pizza was kind of soggy.  This wasn't great, but the tomato sauce was extremely flavorful.  I thought the ratio of tomato sauce to cheese was too skewed in the sauce direction; it made it somewhat difficult to eat without sauce sliding everywhere.  The sausage and onion were really good - a little light on the sausage, but everything held together better than the margherita.  My pizza came to about $19, including tax.\n\nI think Howie's pizza is best when eaten immediately, i.e. dining in, instead of take-out.

No food item is improved by sticking it in a bag where it will collect steam and the bread will lose its crispness.\n2) It's a new food item, you want feedback.  You want to come around and ask people \"How is it?  Could we improve it?\" etc, instead of \"Here's your lunch, now scram.\"\n3) If you don't want to give a table away in a small restaurant so cheaply why not just offer a carry-out discount so that the sandwich is $5 carry-out or $7 to eat in?\n4) Customer goodwill is pretty important.  I would have been really happy if I came away thinking \"They said carryout only but they were flexible and let me eat here because it's 100 degrees outside and there's nobody here, that was nice of them,\" and I would have definitely come back.  Instead all I learned was that policy comes first and they don't really care what I think.\n\nFor the sake of objectivity, I will say the sandwich itself was good, and definitely a great deal for $5.  I think Jujube's is slightly better but it's also a good deal smaller and it's a little more expensive.  If you want a Banh Mi and you, for example, think it's reasonable to have to carry your lunch to Caribou Coffee to eat if you want to be out of the heat, then it's pretty good.", "type": "review", "business_id": "lvSBv-XzfzFj3oT2l6q4Jw"},

I would argue with them that they close at 9, but they just apologized and sent me away.\n\nI don't know why people like this place so much. Okay so let me talk about the food for starters. Maybe it's because I only go at night, but Chinese Express tastes like it was delivered by express mail or something because that chicken, rice, and chow mein is stale! It was disgusting. I did gobble it down because Chinese food is always pretty good, but mine was hot out of a frying pan and it still wasn't very tasty.\n\nAnother thing is that they only take cash. I had to go run to the ATM to get some cash and upon paying the cashier gave me the most janky, pink colored $5 bill that was ripping as my change. I asked to get another one, but he was super stingy and said he closed the register as he was actually closing it so he wouldn't be able to give me a different $5.\n\nBut if you're looking for cheap chinese food with pretty good portions eat at this place. It's not anything you MUST try, but its just that typical cheap chinese take out food so if you're broke and feel like eating paper.

I had my baguette with nutella, cafe au lait and orange juice before leaving to tackle the museums for the day.  I'd return to the hotel late at night and converse in english with the front desk before retiring to my room.  Traveling alone was liberating but also felt very isolating.  My little hotel felt like home and by the time my trip was over I was sad to leave the little family who worked there, who made my bed, who fed me breakfast, who tried to help me with simple french phrases.\n\nWhile I made this trip to SLO with the dr. and I didn't need the B&B staff to serve as my mini-family, staying at Petit Soleil made me feel like I was back at Hotel Familia in Paris.  The quaint decor and the courtyard are nice.  You can rent the bikes they have in the bike racks near the front door.

They also now offer 2 cup sizes so you don't feel like an absolute glutton when you bring your $7 cup to the register; I can happily fill up on the small size and have it total under $5.\n\nBut more so than anything else, Twist has improved on the previously mundane decor by having paintings by a local artist all over the store. The art is cheery, eclectic and quite interesting to look at. It doesn't have the commercial hip, trendy feel of Pinkberry, but it is warm, inviting, and they actually WANT you to sit and stay! Pinkberry's decor for sure is very chic, but those wire chairs aren't exactly intended for comfort. There have been times when I've felt that the chairs are designed so you don't linger too long, so the next customers can sit too. It's not that way at Twist at all. People linger and hang out because the leather chairs are comfortable and no one will ever bother you. While I said in my first review that Twist lacks a lot of the charm of Pinkberry and Red Mango, I can safely say that this isn't true anymore. I find that there's something slightly boring now about the decor and feel of the millions of froyo places that dot the city. If anything, Twist brings a fresh perspective (or twist you could say) of what it means to be a small business reinterpreted on the back of a raging fad.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_5_xjb9WdlGQ9BCnnLPHSg"},

Now the soups are being over-seasoned with heavy handed doses of curry powder, dill, and what tastes like artificial smoke flavoring, but ironically lack salt and pepper.

Their soups used to consistently wow me, but I can't remember the last time I had one that was even passable. Sandwich fixings are being poorly cut so you end up with things like half inch thick cucumber slices and bread of wildly different sizes on either side of the sandwich. Portion sizes are also shrinking to the point of ridiculousness, and the cup of soup for (i believe) $3.50 is becoming increasingly offensive.   Prices overall have gotten pretty nuts.  Today I spent over $12 on a half sandwich/soup combo with which I was given very little soup, a pastry, and a bottle of water that they didn't actually ever give me.

It reminds me of a bustling Jewish deli in New York; the space is cramped and loud, and the atmosphere is chintzy and fun.\n\nService is a bit brusque as the place gets very busy, and they need to move customers through quickly; however, despite a line, we were seated very in only a few minutes. We placed our order outside (as we were told to do), so it was already in by the time we were seated; however, we didn't have a lot of time to take in the menu, and there were things listed inside that I hadn't noticed on the menu they handed us (ex. certain 'special' frappes and simple cheeseburgers). People were packed in, and we had to move our chairs or get up entirely several times throughout the meal to let people pass.\n\nDuring my first trip, I got The Hillary Clinton burger (grilled mushrooms and sour cream). I ordered my burger medium rare, and it was perfectly cooked. Although I enjoyed the burger immensely, I wished I had ordered something cheesier. The next trip, I ordered the Ted Kennedy (cheddar cheese and grilled mushrooms). This time, I found the burger to be a bit over-cooked, with the outside tasting a bit burnt and dry. For a $10+ burger, I was a bit disappointed. \n\nBoth times I ordered a frappe (Elvis -- chocolate, banana, Reese's -- and chocolate, respectively), and while good, they weren't quite thick enough.\n\nOverall, it's a fun place with good, interesting burgers.

Our server was quite attentive and helpful. We never had a problem in this area. The corkage fee for our bottles of wine was $15 and this was told to us when we made the reservations, which I appreciate. The cocktails were good. They had a variety of fun and creative cocktails to try. \n\nThe Spanish Manchega fondue was excellent and you can request how spicy you want it. The meat fondue only  had a broth to dip in. Unilke Melting Pot where you  have a choice of broths or even oil to fry things up. The desert fondue seemed to be lacking in the dippy treats. Where's poundcake?  Marshmallows?  Brownies? graham crackers? Just fruit and rice crispy squares. And the twix bars peices were chocolate overkill. Yea, I know, is that possible?  Yes.  The fondues were about 22-$25 bucks. \n\nWhat we were NOT informed when we made reservations is that a $5 entertainment fee for each person is added to the bill. ??

Although it is not a steakhouse, there is an emphasis on red meat with 4 printed menu choices (the tederloin, the signature steak, the rib eye and the short rib) and a quotidian special (last friday was veal).  Then again there's lots of fish - same deal as the beef with 4 printed choices (halibut, salmon, sea bass and a fish of the day) and a daily special (yes, in addition to the fish of the day).  What I'm trying to say is this:  lots of choices.  Because in addition to all this red meat and fish The Heights offers pork chops, laquered duck, rack of lamb, a vegetarian napoleon, even pizzas.  And the wine list includes well over 100 choices, $45 and up per bottle (up to an eye popping $250 for a meritage). \n\nSo how is it?  The place is expensive by Ithaca's standards - about $35 per entree, which includes a prosaic salad (either caesar or greens).  The rest of my dinner, however, was superb.  I ordered the beef short ribs which played lead to a supporting cast of bacon, potato gnocchi and broccoli rabe.  Wow!  The ribs were cut in the flanken style and wonderful.  But the bacon stole the show.  It was not what I expected, but instead a thick slab of pork fat woven through with generous threads of what we (or at least I) think of as bacon.  In fact this bacon was like bacon in reverse.  Instead of a predominance of cured crispy pork belly with a trim of white fat this was a predominance of white fat with an interior trim of cured crispy pork belly.  But whatever (and how is pork belly not fat I can hear some of you say); it was delicious.  I can't believe I ate the whole thing.  So the food at least was five-star.\n\nLess impressive was the flatware (boring and lacking heft), the glassware (a bit dusty) and the service (what? you can't memorize the specials).  Dessert, back to the actual food, was good (though not thrilling) as we split an appley bread pudding with a scoop of ordinary iced cream.  Although we were sharing we were each given our own plate, which was thoughtful, although somehow not as much as fun.  I also had espresso (well done) and drambuie (not so much), served as it was in a glass both ridiculous and impractical (how about a snifter?).\n\nThe excellence of the entree, however, made this an experience worth the price, which is saying quite a lot (at least here in our little town).", "type": "review", "business_id": "U51HmRCmyf62KTj_rVtdcg"},

I just want some Ma Po sauce.. oh there isn't any. I just want some good Japanese rice.. oh I have to buy a 20 kilo bag. I just want to browse around and come up with ideas.. oh I've tripped over some awkward pile of pots and electrical fans.\n\nI think I like Super 88 a lot more.

I switched to the deluxe sandwich recently, and I feel that the sprouts and tomato are well worth the extra 30 cents to upgrade the standard version.

FOOD SHOULD COME TOGETHER PEOPLE!\n\nStrike 4 is THE FOOD:  Thinking the most expensive thing on the dish would be half good (THE SEA BASS) but nooo... it was tiny (compared to the people around me who ordered the sword fish, and other plates... mine had to be the smallest there... which prompted this review). It also was sub par... only warm not hot especially for the time we waited.  It also tasted like something I cooked at a university rez out of the frozen super market... DISAPPOINTED!\n\nHer chicken and waffles were tasty I have to admit but SMALL! Seems like a soul food place with a minimalist dish... not impressed.

They were decent compared to other sushi places and definitely not worth it.  \n\nThe Sashimi Boat was around $32? This has to be the FRESHEST sashimi I have tasted in a japanese restaurant, particularly the Blue Fin. I can taste the natural sweetness of the fish (not a funky odor) and it melted in my mouth. I think there were 9 different types of fish, 3 pieces each. It included, from what i remember: blue fin, yellowtail, tuna, mackerel, salmon, ..... This dish was definitely high quality in terms of freshness and taste, but I would not order it again. It's more like a one-time-trying-experience.\n\nChirashi and Tempura - $17: Mediocre veggie and shrimp tempura as well as mediocre sashimi. When comparing the sashimi from this plate to the sashimi from the boat, there was a noticeable difference in the color, texture and taste of the two. The ones from the bowl were more vibrant in color, firm and easier to chew. I kinda wish i didn't order this one, but the rice and tempura did keep us full, i guess.\n\nThe Sushi Super plate was around 20 something? There was around 14 kinds of sushi, including uni, salmon roe, shrimp, tuna, salmon, eel, yellowtail, calamari,  and some other kinds of sushi i did not recognize. Very fresh. \n\nWell this is what i got out of my experience at Matsuri, I will be coming back to try some sushi rolls, instead of mainly sashimi. Total not including tips was arounf $87.

The Hummingbird, however, was a little try (but I am told that's how that particular one is suppose to be).  The frosting is cream cheese heavy as Anna W. mentions in her wonderful review.

My hubby and I ordered their gelato as it came highly recommended by my brother-in-law and sister too.  I tried their lemon lychee gelato as well as their tiramisu gelato.  My husband ordered their strawberry gelato as well as the lemon lychee.  The lemon lychee had a nice flavor to it but a bit on the artificial side and the tiramisu was decent.  However, the consistency was a bit different than what I am use to.  I have to say, I have had better gelato and flavor choices at Pazzo Gelato in Silverlake (LA).  \n\nBut another thing about this place is that it does have a variety of desserts to choose from, not just gelato.  They have crepes, ice cream, shaved ice.  So maybe, in the future we will skip the gelato, and try the other items on their menu.  Yeah, I am willing to give them a second chance.\n\nBTW, the lady working behind the counter was super nice and helpful and the place itself appears very clean and well kept. :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "8-vPFqN5jGmQ89KfoDDilA"},

I ordered the smoked salmon tartine which was very good.  The salmon was lightly coated with dill and tasted very fresh.  It was presented on a very simple dish containing about 5 triangular slices of bread upon which the salmon rested.  Cucumbers, avocado slices, & fresh greens were also on the dish.  The bread basket contained a variety of delicious breads, one that contained dried fruits was a little too sweet for my taste.\n\nAs far as service was concerned, this particular day they were SEVERELY understaffed.  We waited for almost 30 minutes to be seated when we were told it was only a 5 minute wait.  Multiple tables on the outdoor seating section (where we sat) had been left uncleaned and vacant the entire duration of our wait and one was only cleaned off when we inquired on the wait time.  Once we sat, it was another 15 minutes before the server took our drink order, and again, it  was only because we flagged him down to help us.  after about 10 more minutes, we received our drinks- which came after the 2 parties who were seated after us.  By the time our food arrived, we had been at the restaurant for 1.5 hours total.  We obviously complained to the manager and the response we received was an idiotic \"well, you know it's parents' week at the colleges so there are just too many people here today\".    I don't see how any of that was of my concern and feel that  since they obviously knew it was parents week, they should have planned accordingly and scheduled the appropriate number of staff to work that day so that the experience would have been a less sour one.\n\nI'm not saying i'll never go back there, but if someone mentions it, i'll be more than reluctant to say yes.", "type": "review", "business_id": "nbYDvcIjQf5bioEefypkYQ"},

There's no beer on tap. As in none. Bottles? Well, there's Sam and Sam Light...and then a bunch of your usual American Light water/beer. Seriously though, nothing on tap.\n\nI was hoping the food would make up for it.\n\nIt didn't.\n\nMy \"red, white and blue\" onion soup was just meh. Also, it came out almost immediately after ordering, so I know it wasn't fresh baked. The menu boasted of caramelizing both white and red onions in Sam Adams beer. First, as they have no beer on tap, did they crack bottles for cooking?? Also, my thin slice of baguette had a layer of blue cheese coating it. Fine. However, the slice of bread was significantly smaller than the bowl of soup. As such, the bread and cheese were submerged in an attempted to eat it. This resulted in both disintegrating in the broth. Generally, the soup tasted okay, but was much less exciting than the menu led me to believe.\n\nFor my entre I got the \"catch of the day\". I put it in quotes as this catch was Tilapia. To my knowledge, Tilapia is native to Africa and parts of Asia...not New England...thus making me question it's \"catch of the day\" status. The dish was supposed to be served wrapped in bacon, topped with some kind of tomato salsa/sauce/chutney/thing with a side of cilantro rice and asparagus. That sauce stuff was disgusting and uninspired. There are more spices in the world than salt and chili paste. I don't eat bacon, so got my fish without. I can only imagine how salty the dish would have been if I hadn't requested it without bacon. The rice was just meh. Again, way too much salt. The asparagus was of the way too slender variety and many of the ends were tough. The only thing I finished on my plate was the asparagus....and that's because I really love asparagus.\n\nThe waitress was nice, but really just okay. When she recited the specials it seemed rehearsed and like she was straining to remember what they were. We were never asked if we wanted a dessert menu, simply just given them...one menu even being placed in my brother's hand.\n\nMany hotels have stepped up their restaurants so as to compete with the plethora of options available in the city.

I will be calorie frugal.  I will maximize value and minimize unhealthy eating.  I will make good food choices.  \n\nThus, I did a price comparison between D'Yar and Cal Gyro.  Cal Gyro is more expensive.  For the wraps, the difference is less than 50c.  For the plates, the difference is much more noticeable.  A typical chicken plate here is $6.49.  That's with hummus, salad, rice (or fries) and meat.  At Cal Gyro, it's $9.99.  \n\nI got the beef kebab plate.  When the lady asked whether I wanted fries or rice, I got all confused.  I'm so bad at making decisions.  Especially when it comes to horizontally bad food choices.  It was ready in a jiffy.  The weather was very hot outside so I enjoyed watching the inappropriately dressed young students walk, up and down, up and down to fetch their foods.  A young man sitting by the table chowing down on a rice bowl ($4.99 special of the day) asked for some pickled radishes.  I want pickles too!  These were the purple kind, the kind that is also served with the pita that has a pocket in the middle.  The other places that serve thick pita does not have purple pickled radishes and their hummus is rather gross.  \n\nWhen I got home, I sat down in the little al fresco sun room my parents built.  As I opened my bounty, I heard the strangest noise, like a very small semi-tractor starting up.  Turns out it was a hummingbird fight!  Two hummingbirds put their dukes up and fought it out in the yard.  It was a good sign for the food.  The beef was not overly salty and still tender.  It had nice char marks on the outside.  The rice had those little toasted noodles that I've heard so much about.  And peas.  The salad had little grape tomatoes.  And the hummus was quite tasty.

Animals  appear to be well cared for, fit, healthy and the entire zoo is so well maintained and clean.  Landscaped beautifully too.\n\nAlong with my husband, we had 3 guys from Vera Cruz and another from San Diego with us.  My San Diego friend reluctantly admitted Houston has a nice zoo -  but staying loyal to his hometown, still had to put in a few comments or more about how much better \"his\" zoo was.  Hubby and I loved it as did the guys from Mexico.  We had a really nice time on a off and on drizzly day so luckily crowds were minimal  \n\nEspecially fun for us was seeing Tucker the 4 y/o elephant and his mom, Tess.  They came from elephant conservationists in SoCal who are friends of ours - we first met Tucker as a 500 pound baby in SoCal at his earlier home.  Many zoos wanted Tess and Tucker - it was because of the high standards of the Houston Zoo that they went here.  Otherwise our friends would have never ever given them up  unless they were positive they would be in good hands. \n\nWe particularly liked the sea lion show - their grace their charm, the primate area, and the children's area.\n\n Gift store had fun stuff to buy -  mostly reasonable priced, decent and cool - not stupid souvenirs that break before you get home ( well, maybe some merchandize was like that)  but overall a nice little gift shop.  \n\nWe - obviously - didn't go to the zoo for food - hadn't plan to eat but ended up getting a few snacks and coffee. Prices were lower and better than what I expected.  Nice, that in addition to the ubiquitous burgers, fries and pizza  also have fruit cups, fresh fruit and yogurt.  \n\nAll in all we had a really nice day and I look forward to another zoo visit next year. \n\nParking is free but recommend you take the train as parking fills up quickly.

Where else can you get Cocks' Combs and Duck Fries on the same menu? Sadly, this was one of the few times on my trip that I passed up something I was curious about, as the idea of doing a cured meat degustation tasting on my own sounds great but I know I wouldn't even be able to tackle dinner after.\n\nMy only major complaint with New Rivers is something I encountered almost immediately upon entering and which continued throughout the whole dinner, and that is the piss poor attitude I received from my server. This was a rarity during my trip to Providence, which is partly what made this experience stand out even more. Not long after sitting down at the table the hostess put my at my waitress came by and informed me there were also seats available at the bar. I'm sorry, do you know WANT my money? Because I'll gladly just leave the restaurant and pay someone who wants to wait on me...\n\nFortunately the quality of the food far outweighed the service from those providing it, so I was able to see past the bitchy attitude and enjoy my meal. Apparently there was a Restaurant Week in Providence not long before my arrival, and the trend of prix-fixe menus was so popular in the fine dining restaurants that they decided to continue the option on a regular basis. I opted for the set menu on this night, primarily due to one of my favorite items (pork belly) being one of the offerings.\n\nThey start you here with a wonderful sampling of breads, and a really delicious spread made of chickpeas and white beans. Two of the breads in particular were very good, the rosemary covered loaf and the cheese covered bread stick. Rarely do I splurge on the bread in a restaurant prior to the meal coming, but I couldn't resist here.\n\nFor my first course of the night I selected the tomato water gazpacho. I'm normally not a fan of any type of gazpacho, mainly because cold soup just isn't appealing to me texturally, but this one was surprisingly good. The diced red pepper, cucumber, onion pair so well with the flavor of the tomato water, and it's a very refreshing flavor that I can imagine would be perfect on a hot sunny day on a patio. Accompanying the gazpacho is a pair of basil crostinis with melted cheese in the middle, great for dipping in the gazpacho to enjoy a whole medley of flavors. \n\nThe main course was my entire reason for choosing the prix-fixe menu, the pork belly. It was slow cooked with shittake mushrooms, carmelized onions, zucchini and red peppers. The presentation was like something out of a child's book, bringing up memories of playing in the woods, surrounded by all the earthy ingredients. It really was something beautiful to behold.\n\nUnfortunately, the desert I was really looking forward to, the rhubarb and strawberry tart, was no longer being served, which was really disappointing as I was looking forward to my first taste of rhubarb in the northeast. They ended up replacing it with a pecan-rum ice cream, topped with a bit of melted Belgian chocolate. The flavor of the ice cream was pretty nice, and I liked the texture of the bits of whole pecan that were left in, but the chocolate on top was just overkill, and a bit too dark in my opinion, often overpowering the ice cream.\n\nI thought New Rivers offers many good culinary surprises, and has the potential to be a real star in the Providence dining scene, but they still have a way to go to in order to catch up with some of the bigger stars.

In both cases, Diddy Riese has turned those bad days into GREAT days!  The first time was after a body-cramping and day-ruining experience at Tia Juana's in Irvine - unfortunately I had food poisioning but I still enjoyed the bite that I was able to try.  The second time was an attempt to see Amy Goodman in Pasadena but she was booked up full - so FAIL!  Shucks... but at least the night ended by waiting in the line ride at Diddy Riese for a DELICIOUS, day redeeming ice cream and cookie sammy.  \n\nThe cookies are so soft and tender.  It was just the right amount of chewiness to give you sufficient time to savor the flavor of lightly caramelized brown sugar and toasty aroma of the oatmeal with brief bursts of tart sweetness from the studding of warm raisins throughout the oatmeal cookie.  Imagine that cookie with decadent, milky, sweet cream folded with chunks of slightly frozen, tangy and smooth strawberry cheesecake.  The chocolate chip cookie was just as good as the oatmeal cookie.  The chips are small, but there are a lot in the cookie, so you're not missing out on gooey chocolate that will end up oozing all over your delicious mint chocolate chip ice cream.  The mint was so refreshing with slivers of dark chocolate veins throughout the pastel green cream.  Can you also believe a sammy is only $A BUCK FIDDY?  Love it.  \n\nJust thinking about Diddy Riese makes me happy, and it helps me to think up new combinations of ice cream sammies for my next \"bad day\"!", "type": "review", "business_id": "piXuRfZ81xFGA64WFJrKkQ"},

We called for a reservation but it was last minute and they told us there's no wait to sit on the patio. So we proceeded to drive there. FYI, you have to valet. Thank goodness my boyfriend drove because I would have been a little embarrassed rolling up to the valet in my non-European made car.\n\nWe were seated right away. The patio is very quaint and faces out to Bissonet. Most of the people dining there were an \"old money\" or \"country club\" type crowd. It sort of reminded me of Backstreet Cafe. I felt a little under dressed in jeans and a fitted tee. Maybe that would explain the mediocre service...\n\nThe waitress came and took our drink orders. We just asked for water since we were still looking at the wine menu. She said she would be back to give us the food menu. 10 minutes later, she comes back. She gives us our food menu. We ordered a glass of house wine. 10 minutes later, she comes back with the bottle of wine and lets us sample the house wine before pouring us a whole glass (very nice of her). The wine tasted like the bottle had been open for a few days though. She poured our glasses and then left for ANOTHER 10 minutes. By this time, we were really ready to order our food already. In total, we waited 40 minutes before we could even order our food. \n\nThe only saving grace was that the food was pretty good and came out timely. I had a chicken breast stuffed with cheese in a wine sauce. My boyfriend had a veal with a tomato mushroom sauce. Both were served with mixed grilled veggies. The prices for the dishes were both very reasonable too (under $20). The food was very fresh and the meats were tender.\n\nSo maybe it was an off night? I don't know if the atmosphere is quite right for me. A lot of older rich people. So I'd recommend the place if you want a nice Italian meal in West U, but I think I'll continue my hunt for a better Italian place in Houston.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zYymsWEVEy02KA2KES1faw"},

That falafel is also a bit more spicy.\n\nOverall a very good meal - will come back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "rFscSQwEcsYmQexb1Jqjcw"},

This was much better - it was cooked just long enough and the texture was bang on (although I would have appreciated it if the macadamia nuts were a little more seared rather than warm and soft).  \n\nThe lesson: I would stay away from the daily specials until they have some time to get things right. \n\nFood is overseasoned: the crab, the rice and the salmon were way overseasoned, especially with salt. I like flavorful dishes with a lot of punch, but this meal just left me thirsty. Salt might be an easy way to make things taste good, but this was a consistent problem across dishes.\n\nCombinations make little sense: the flavors in the butters served with the bread were all over the place, and clearly reflected an interest in novel tastes, rather than a thoughtful combination. For some reason, a pico de gaillo arrived with all my mains, even the salmon, where it clearly did not belong. \n\nPROS: \n\nSeasonal vegetables were awesome. I appreciated that they thought to include fiddleheads (very seasonal and underused) and they were cooked just right - warm, seared and crisp, a perfect al dente - all three times I tried them. \n\nService was great: Wait staff worked really hard to fix the problems caused by the kitchen. Very patient and understanding. Very attentive\n\nAmbiance is romantic: Good lighting, thoughtfully arraigned space, exposed brick etc. Nicest location in Ann Arbor\n\nDrink selections are great: I'm a bit of a beer snob - their list is small but thoughtful. \n\nIn short, this place might be worth going to for drinks and appetizers, but for the price of their entrees you could probably just buy a gigantic block of salt and call it a day. This is not worth the hype and fares poorly compared to Vinology or the Earle.", "type": "review", "business_id": "57VozB9tq5SbNst9nO-jxA"},

I thought the egg's benedict was good but the french toast was a little dry. The potatoes were well seasoned and made the perfect side. One of the coolest things I liked about this place was that you can order all their brunch entrees as a half order for half the price. That's freaking awesome and even more awesome for not overpricing you to do so. \n\nI definitely want to return and try some more dishes. :)  Also while you wait for your food, they give you crayons and paper table cloth so you can draw on the table like kids again.

I brought 10 items in, so they rejected a couple pairs of jags, a pr of Sevens, and a tee.\n\nThe buyer was fast and pretty friendly, I felt the rejections were okay - if a little mystifying - and I will be selling more stuff next week to see how I fare.  I have to give kudos to the staff for being friendly & helpful - so many times you go into consignment/resale places and walk out feeling like dirt.\n\nAs far as buying, I've found some great stuff here.

Oh, don't worry SNS, you've received plenty of my money in the past for all your advertising.  \n\nAs I was already on Lake Avenue (see above), and happened upon Mattress City's new store, I forced myself to continue the drudgery of keeping yet another Bed Salesman at bay. I was convinced this was just another place I'd check off my list as a no go.\n\nSO glad I dragged my butt in there! THESE GUYS... they elevated the mattress shopping experience to new heights. Bent over backwards to make sure I got an amazing bed at an amazing price. Serious bang for the buck--AND all the bells and whistles were thrown in. James even brought it to my attention I might want a shorter box spring in combination with my deep mattress so the two would fit my vintage frame better--THANK YOU! It would have really bugged me if it were taller and as predicted, my new set fits the frame perfectly. \n\nI love, love, love my bed and the sound sleep I'm getting--couldn't be happier with their product and service. I'm so enthused about them, I will dig a little deeper in conversation about one needing a new mattress just so I can recommend Mattress City!\n\nThanks again, guys!", "type": "review", "business_id": "XUEwSGOGARxW-3gPiGJKUg"},

The naan was nicely fluffy and went well with the curry sauce.  The gulab jamun was a bit soggy for my taste, and the rice pudding a tad bit too sweet, but overall the desserts were a nice touch.

The food pales in comparison and what's even more infuriating is crappy food being exhorbitantly priced. My lunch alone cost me slightly below $50 and I was served a shrimp ceviche that really was just shrimp cocktail (bleah!) . At least the fish tacos fared better but at $14, it didn't come cheap. Since servings were tiny and taste truly mediocre, I decided to order on - although I should have gone with my instinct rather than my hunger pangs and gone somewhere else at that point. However, I spotted the fried plantains and tres leche dessert, both which I love and figured no one effs these dishes up.... after all one is a side dish. But OMG the fried plantains ended up being some crap served with weird sauce accompaniment and queso blanco. When the dish was set before me I was thinking WTF is that and what is the white stuff on the bananas.... whipped cream? The combination tasted awful. And the tres leche, was basically some lousy sponge cake with milk all over. VERY DISAPPOINTING MEAL.

Girly?  Eh, sure, maybe, but it sounded good.\n\nFrom the appetizer menu, we decided to order the beef/lettuce cups we were told about, as well as some coconut shrimp.\n\nThe drinks were brought out crazy-fast and both were very good.  We always try each other's drinks/beers, and we both thought both drinks were good.  My lemonade/coco-rum drink was definitely well made - the coconut rum dominated, but the lemonade provided a nice contrast to it.  Overall, the drink wasn't super-sweet, which I like.\n\nThe food, too, came out VERY fast! (Kitchen is bored, the server said.)\n\nThe coconut shrimp were good, if a little \"standard.\"  I mean, once you've had coconut shrimp, there's not a lot new or \"wow\" to experience.  The place either screws it up (overfrying, too much breading, wrong fryer temp leading to too much oil) or they don't.  Red Seven didn't screw it up, and the dish was good.\n\nThe beef/lettuce \"cups\" were not what I expected.  What you get is a serving dish of a beef, vegetable, and sauce concoction, with 4-5 leaves of romaine on the side.  You then spoon some of the beef mixture onto a leaf and eat it.  There is no \"cup.\"  \n\nThat said, the dish wasn't bad.  A little too sweet for my tastes, but I prefer non-dessert food to be not sweet at all.  A little too saucy as well, but I figured with something being called \"beef lettuce cups\" it would be mostly beef and perhaps not even sauced at all.  Ah well - it's not \"terrible\" - just not what I expected and a little too sweet for me.\n\nThat was the extent of our food/drink ordering as this was just a pre-show nosh.  We often just split an appetizer or two - portions sizes being what they are these days, it's the best way to eat out and yet still maintain fitness/weight. :)\n\nWe will probably go back, either for drinks, or perhaps to try an entree.", "type": "review", "business_id": "JQPvIx1aJVu_ZNoZ5Uqsbg"},

Who else wears HARVARD paraphernalia?  (I went to fancy schools too, but I keep the insignia limited to pajamas.)  The COOP had dozens of baseball caps, and I saw one that had a distinctly Ed Hardy aesthetic with paint splatter and thick HARVARD lettering.  Classy, that.

I don't like that the fiction is tucked away on an upper floor, but the display tables are well curated and the selection of books is extensive.  The store is also clean and a little bit pretty.\n\nI've been to the actual Harvard bookstore, and it's much better than the COOP, if what you're after is books.

They want to go fishing with you.\n\nThis is all part of the experience at Box and Box.

They have a decent collection of used watches (including a gorgeous Patek and a few Rolexes).  \n\nBut what really makes Box and Box stand out?  They don't know how to push a sale.

It is definitely worth checking out, if only to get a refreshing difference from the monotony in Rice Village.\n*************************************\nUpdate:  I just got my ring from Box (almost a whole week early!) and it is gorgeous!

After we chose the stone, we were given the option of designing our own band (which we had planned to do) or to look through their bands that were already made (all custom designs).  I found one that fit perfectly with what we were going for and they had the stone set in less than a week.

I answered \"medium,\" but of course this is a relative term. She started massaging me very hard, and didn't ask if the pressure was okay, so I had to tell her over and over again throughout the whole massage to lighten up because she would forget 5 minutes later and I would be wincing in pain. \n\nSo today I am sitting here with big bruises on my butt, and between my shoulders because my masseuse didn't listen to me.

The downstairs area is more intimate, quieter and darker. The noise level stays at a low hum in the evening even with a full house. The decor is understated and classic.\n\nThere are black and white framed photographs that punctuate an elegant atmosphere of mostly taupe and coffee bean brown. Downstairs, there is a marble countertop at the bar. A few lamps with scarlet red lampshades sit on the bar. Look up and you will see little boathouses suspended from the ceiling with four bulbs as passengers.\n\nBeing so close to Harvard University, you can expect a mixed crowd. You may dress casually or dress up. The waitstaff is friendly and knowledgable about wine and which food goes well with which wine. Feel free to ask questions. You will find them to be attentive.\n\nThe wine selection is extensive, as one would expect from a tavern. There are several things to consider when choosing a wine. They offer one organic selection, ten sustainable ones and three biodynamic wines.\n\nAdditionally, there are sixteen different wines that you can have by the glass and twelve of these are under ten dollars. There are two wines offered on tap at only five dollars a glass and both of these are good values for the price.\n\nAt nine dollars a glass, the Motos Liberty Cabernet Sauvignon is a wonderful choice. Drink it slowly and savor each sip. It does down very smoothly and has a fruity taste. Both the body of the wine and the sweetness are medium. It has a hint of a pepper taste. Interestingly, the aftertaste is even better than the intial moment you experience with the wine in your mouth.\n\nAnother good choice at a somewhat higher price is the Benxziner Pinot Noir from the Sonoma Coast of California. This choice is one of the ten sustainable offerings at the Russell.\n\nThe Russell House Tavern also offers eleven different small plates for under ten dollars each. The Redondo Black Serrano Ham with House Pickled Pears and Honey Torched Manchego is a lovely choice with the Cabernet Sauvignon.

I have gone to the museum and IMAX several times before, but those were so long ago I can't even remember what show I watched there.  I did wind up at the Museum during one of the Music under the Stars on a Friday night.  A band plays as a crowd dances around in the grass. The alcohol there is priced like alcohol at the Toyota Center.  7 bucks for a beer??!?!  That's nuts.  I say get there already sloshed at those prices.  Other than that, it's pretty neat just to hang out, listen to music, and watch kids dance to Latin music.  \n\nOn Wednesday, I went to the IMAX with a fellow yelper, Chris M., to see the Dark Knight.  I secretly think that he just wanted to see me scared to death.  That's a common goal for many people come to think of it.\n\nA few tips about the IMAX: *Lines for the Dark Knight are probably going to be incredibly long and crowded, even for the next month.  Get there early, cut in front of people, or get crappy seats.  \n\n*The parking garage under the museum is free after 6 pm.  The sign is small, so now you know.  \n\n*The only food and drinks allowed are candy and bottles with a screw top.  Sorry, no pop corn with the Joker.  Either eat first or hide food in your purse or manbag.  \n\nThe seats there are nice.  The bathrooms are clean.  The place is kept neat and tidy.  \n\nI don't think I have to review the Dark Knight because if it raked in 158.3  million opening weekend, chances are you've already watched it.  Now I'm a chicken when it comes to scary movies.  I openly admit it.  I know as a phlebotomist (for my research) who engages in autocrossing, skydiving, regular visits to prisons (for work, CSI style), and other \"dangerous\" activities, I should not be scared of a movie.  I am scared though.  Even 4 days later, I'm still a little scared that the Joker might pop out and ask \"Why so serious?\"  \n\nUnfortunately, since the movie was packed, the only seats that were not in the front row were on different rows.  Chris M. sat a few rows above me.  I sat next to two teenage boys.  During the one part (you know which part, I won't spoil it for the few who haven't watched the movie yet), I screamed and jumped.  The two boys next to me giggled and pointed at me.  They did that repeatedly during the movie.  I was terrified.  Oh, and yeah, Chris M. did confirm that I had indeed jumped 3 feet straight up during that one scene.  \n\nAfter the movie, I turned on my phone as we were getting into the elevator.  The first thing that popped up was a text message that said \"HELP\" from a friend who was supposed to be on his way to Belize the next morning.  \n\nThis is a person that I've known for years that is just as much as an adrenaline junkie as I am.  He never freaks and always knows what to do in a tight situation.  The fact that I get a text that says \"HELP\" actually freaks me out.  He does drive some rare and sporty vehicles so the first thing that I think of is that someone is car jacking him.  Everyone else in the crowded elevator hears me panicking.  One woman leans over and says, \"It's time to call the BATMAN!\"  Everyone cracks up.  I'm still freaking out.  \n\nI finally get out of the elevator and into cell service range.  I call him wondering if it's time to spring into action.  I do love one of the cars as much, if not more than he does.  He picks up.  \"Hullo.\"  \"Are you okay?\" \"Yeah, I'm just packing for my trip.\"  \"Are the cars okay?\"  \"Yeah.\"  \"How come you texted HELP?\"  *Laughing*  \"I texted HELO, but the iphone autocorrected it to HELP.\"  \"That's not funny.\"  *Laughing*  \"Dork, I'll talk to you later.\"\n\nTip for Iphone users: Wautch owT 4 de aouto-corRrekt.", "type": "review", "business_id": "DZXp8m38R0s9U3Saj4Qbcw"},

I finally got around to it, and my emotions are mixed.  First, I was super pumped by Tony's review.  Then I got there, and was a little disappointed.  \n\nThe store section:  Pretty much carries the necessities of Indian cooking; spices, rice, random selections of American based companies selling their stuff for an Indian market.  Their produce section was small, but what they did have was fresh and cheap, including peppers, onions, coconut and mango.  There is a $10 minimum to use your credit/debit card.\n\nThe Kitchen of India (the \"take-out/restaurant\" part): I wish they would put a \"wholly owned subsidiary of Foods of India\" sign underneath the window, but that would be silly.  Anyway, it's in the back of the store, with two tables, and a tiny \"kitchen\" that had four burners and what I think was a clay oven?  It's pretty hole in the wall, but that makes for good food, right? The menu is small, but there's a little bit of everything for everyone if you like chicken or you're a vegetarian, and the prices are decent ($7-10). There were two guys working, the guy at the register was brand spankin' new (as in first day) and was overwhelmed by the three people ordering/picking up food.  I had to help him with the credit card machine to charge me.  The other guy was cooking all of the orders fresh to go- so he was trying to juggle making food and helping the newbie.  \n\nWhich made what I thought would be a quick pop in, order, shop, then get food to go a lot longer than I had hoped.  It took awhile just to get my order, have me pay, and have the two people before me taken care of.  Maybe when newbie gets it together, things will be a lot quicker.  Point: call in your order, like half an hour before you want to pick it up.\n\nBut here is what made everything ok: The food was delicious, so yummy! And the portions are huge!  I got the veggie biryani and the chicken tikka, Andrew and I had dinner, and I think we have enough left over for at least another dinner.  You never get that much at a sit down place. Ever.  The naan was thick and cripsy, perfectly cooked.  The raita?  A little runny and bland, but you get a lot of it, so just use twice as much on your food.  The tikka had some nice heat, and the mix of veggies in the biryani was impressive.", "type": "review", "business_id": "rVf3Kt2QpqqtaluReavP3g"},

It's a small place, and more expensive for many types of items than a supermarket would be, but it's a nice place which only carries good quality food.\n\nIf you're a student at Harvey Mudd or Scripps, then this is a very useful place as it is within easy walking distance, unlike any of the supermarkets in town.\n\nGo to Wolfe's for the foods prepared on-site (sandwiches, salads, etc.) and for the meat counter.  The dairy case and produce are worth checking out as well if you need to pick up a few things to complete a meal.\n\nPackaged foods are not the focus here. The selection won't match any supermarket obviously, and some prices may seem high, but they're not outrageous.  You won't come here to buy cereal or canned soup, but if you need to pick up something to go along with the rest of a meal, they'll probably have it.", "type": "review", "business_id": "fCTkzJC_SGTWMgMNSrApvg"},

The person I spoke to inside was also straight forward but I think they got a wrong read on me. For one, I was dressed like I just rolled out of bed because I had dropped someone off at their work, planned on dropping my car off here and getting  a rental so I could go home and get ready myself. I think I looked like another poor college student, (I may be poor from college, but I'm no longer a college student :P). \n\nSo when I read my list of items, several of the items were just side stepped entirely, including the main reason I was there, the A/C not working. \n\nIssue: A/C doesn't work when driving under 25 mph\nResponse: Air compressor sounds like it's failing, but that's going to cost a lot of money and it's already August so you should probably wait. \n(The A/C sputters and is therefore failing?)\n\nIssue: Fuse for cooler fan blew out, this happened last summer more frequently but happened for the first time this summer a week ago\nResponse: It's probably fine now\n(To me the bearing sounded bad on the fan)\n\nIssue: Temp and Fuel gauges don't work, I have to use the trip and my MPG to estimate my fuel\nResponse: Just leave it how it is, it's going to cost a lot to fix, we don't have the part, and only the dealer can re-calibrate the gauges. \n(I found a do it yourself repair for this including the calibration online, but didn't want to do it myself)\n\nIssue: I personally removed my fan blower motor since it was really easy to access, but the replacement unit I purchased did not use the same plastic pop-rivets, instead used the factory bolts (but did not come with the bolts). I asked if they had the bolts and could put it back on for me while it was in.\nResponse: We don't have the parts\n\nIssue: Brakes sound like a dying goose when I backup, I believe the brake shop I took it to used the wrong pads or didn't calibrate it right, since it never did this before\nResponse: It's probably the material on the pad, sometimes that happens. \n(This sounds terribly loud though, like louder than when a bus stops and at teeth grinding levels)\n\nFixed issue: ABS, Traction and service lights all triggered, presumably my ABS was disabled too. They had to replace a sensor which cost in the low 200s. \n\nSo in the end they fixed the issue that was the most noticeable and could have had serious repercussions in the winter. They fixed it the same day too and for not too much. \n\nBut I wanted to go to a place to get everything taken care of in one fell swoop and hopefully save some money vs. what the dealer would charge since they are notoriously expensive. I will now have to take it to the dealer anyway (or another shop) to have these other issues addressed. \n\nI think they should take the  \"Complete Auto Care\" part off the sign, if it instead said \"Partial Auto Care\" I would have given them 3-4 stars.", "type": "review", "business_id": "wMWMxz3MI3P6j935mtqSYQ"},

The theme of this year's event was something very meaningful to me, Chinese culture.  Chosen to coincide with its current special exhibition [Tracing the Past, Drawing the Future: Master Ink Painters in 20th-Century China], activities for the special Family Day focused on the art, music, dance and storytelling of the Chinese culture.\n\nSeveral volunteer organizations including One Brick and Hands On Bay Area organized large groups of volunteers to come out to help staff the many activities scheduled.  Myself being the volunteer junkie that I am decided I wanted to be part of this event so I signed up through One Brick to be part of volunteer crew.  Once signed in we were told that our volunteers would be staffing children's art projects throughout the museum.\n\nThe art projects included building a Great Wall, creating opera masks, paper blossom trees, paper lanterns (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BOXMGHigA-fvRjwPRBCdGQ?select=gf8inWTzFRxAp2hg29ITpw), coloring pre-printed dragon drawings and the project of my choosing, creating dragon puppets (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BOXMGHigA-fvRjwPRBCdGQ?select=PYBY-Dpp3dCrvYGTtBor9Q).  \n\nFor our hand puppets we had a checklist and some pre-made puppets for display, and our job was to teach any child who wanted to create their own puppet how to do so.  Our involvement varied from child to child, and I found out the best way to determine how much we would help was to ask each individual child directly.  I was amazed by how many trusting parents just left their kids with us and walked away, but many parents stayed also to help their child and join in on the fun.  Working and teaching younger children isn't a task I'm very familiar with, but I actually enjoyed my duties for the day.  In the several hours of working side by side with many preschool children I was quite amazed with their artistic abilities even at their young age.  I can honestly say I did not encounter a single bad child throughout the day.\n\nWe were told the museum staff didn't anticipate the high attendance for this event.  They estimated some 2500 people arrived just in the first hour of the event, but despite the crunch of kids (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BOXMGHigA-fvRjwPRBCdGQ?select=Nea50gG7OX0vYB6Eu73k1A) who showed up we handled the masses well, and judging from the smiles on the kids' faces they had a great time too.\n\nWhat a rewarding way to spend a Sunday afternoon!

I am looking for a nail place to have a nail party for my birthday. Things started off well, since they immediately returned my call and scheduled an appointment. Two days before my scheduled appointment, I received a call saying that the appointment was double booked, and they needed to change my time. That would have been fine, except I travel 100% of the time out of town for work and have a limited amount of time in Atlanta. The appointment was rescheduled, but I was later called and informed that they arranged for an additional person to come in for my original appointment. Great! \n\nThe facility itself is very nice, and I enjoyed my actual services. The problem occurred when the technician looked at my finger nails and realized I needed a gel manicure. She informed me that my appointment was only for a basic manicure and they didn't have enough time scheduled for a gel manicure. My choices were to get a polish change, have my gel removed to get a basic manicure, or pay a cancellation fee for not getting a manicure. WTH???\n\nAlayna came over to explain that because I only asked for a manicure and pedicure, that was the service that I HAD to get or pay a cancellation charge. Really?? Just very matter of fact about it. I explained that my very first time getting gel nails happened 2 weeks prior, and I had no idea that I had to specify that I needed a gel manicure. At Sugarcoat, they specifically asked if I wanted gel nails when I called to schedule the appointment and also told me they would work with me since I wasn't sure what type of nails I wanted to get on that day.

It's so unfortunate, because I was looking forward to bringing a party of 10-15 people to the nail salon to celebrate my birthday. \n\nAs I've seen with previous posts, I'm sure Alayna will offer an explanation in a kind of tongue-in-cheek way.

The guy working was helpful, even though he seemed to automatically resort to them making my copies instead of letting me use the self-service machines (which would have been even cheaper for me). Oh well. I got my file uploaded, sent it to the printer, picked out the color paper (which is what cost depends on), and printed my project on 7-cent green paper.\n\nIt was a good experience and I was happy because the cost was cheaper than... the other place we've recently used for printing. Next time I'll have to remember to use the self-service, though, because I would have been able to use my Student Survival Kit coupon that would have lowered the per-page costs to 4 cents.

Food is pretty good but last time I was there I saw not one but TWO GIANT RATS ON THE DECK!!! \nEveryone, when there is smoke there is fire. You've been warned, and I'll add these were not mice we're talking about here. The food is fine, so I will bump up my review when they take care of this disgusting vermin problem. \n\nThe atmosphere at night (and often in the day) tends to be LOUD. Don't come here if you're looking for a quiet date, unless it's warm out and you can sit outside - I highly recommend the deck, it's beautiful and won't lead you to wear out your vocal cords by the time dinner's over.\n\nWaitresses are very sweet here, and I can say that they've never messed up the bill for us. They'll obsessively refill your water after you've taken one sip so if you're like me and find that annoying while you're trying to eat and converse with your comrades, hide your glass or something.\n\nFood report card:\nDishes overall tend to be not so hot in temperature - Thai food is not the kind of cuisine to eat cold! Most veggie entrees run around $7.95, meat entrees $8.85, and seafood entrees around $11.95 or so. Note that they do NOT INCLUDE RICE usually - it's an extra $1 a person, and that is a royal pain. \n\nPra Ram / Peanut Satay w/ Napa Cabbage - (C+) The peanut sauce here is missing some sort of spice, and I still can't quite figure out what it is. This dish has always been lukewarm (in temperature) when I've ordered it, and I've had it twice. Methinks this is just too much of the kind of thing you could make at home on the stove with the white-bread cultural experience even us Berkelians have foodwise. This is the kind of thing your uncle Joe might make for homecooked Asian night - you know, the guy who insists the only word he needs to know how to spell is \"USA.\" Now, he's a good cook, but he's just too damn simple at it.\nGreen Curry - (A-) I have yet to find a Thai restaurant who has screwed up green curry. There's just something about it. Well done.\nPad Thai Tofu - (B) Average-sized portion; tofu was a little overcooked and noodles too chewy but the sauce was near perfect. Warning: They skimp on the green onion/leeks in here, at least to my taste.\nRed Curry Vegetable - (A) Spicy but not blow-your-brains-out hot; this was cooked perfectly and there was a great curry-to-vegetable ratio which I've found a lot of other places have trouble with. Curry itself was perfect.\nFried Banana with Coconut Ice Cream - (B) Smaller portion of that excellent banana than one would like, but it was pretty good nevertheless. Ice cream was to die for.\nJasmine Rice - (B) Average-sized portion; I've always considered the rice quality to be synonymous with how good the restaurant is (usually). This stuff was a tiny bit dry but nevertheless did the trick.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tR7wIIvJsLqI8keoLf8tpg"},

We chased the main course with some dessert whose name eludes me -- vanilla gelato (was ice cream, far as I could tell) mixed with espresso -- think root beer float style.

My office was in Cambridge Center and has now moved to a new building with a lake in Weston- we call it Gilligan's Island. I was lucky enough to be in Cambridge last night and pick up dinner. I ordered the Fried Rice and the Mushroom Chicken. Fried Rice was typical and yummy the chicken was not  too salty or mushy and the chicken was normal looking and tasting. (You know how you get Chinese food and look at the chicken and think: \"What part of the chicken is THIS?\"- not here) Bonus: I wanted an order of Crab Rangoons and they only had 3 ready (6 make an order) so they fried me up some fresh ones! Yum. The wonton to crabcreaminess ratio was a little off for me, but still, the filling was killer. \n\nI have had their sushi a ton, especially when dieting.

Because it was convenient, I went to them for four years (I'm a Ph.D. student, and thus stuck at school for 6-7).  After putting up with the lines, the fact that the pharmacy is closed all weekend, and the less than prompt refills, I got truly fed up from two incidents.  The first involved my request for summer meds.  Knowing that this can take awhile, I called in my prescription request 8 DAYS before I actually needed it.  I couldn't pick it up until the day before I went out of town, and I wasn't taking any chances.  I figured that they'd call me if there was a problem, right?  Nope.  I get there and they irritably tell me that one of the prescriptions doesn't exist, so they didn't fill it.  I told them that I knew it existed because the doctor had given it to them the day I called in the prescription.  Sure enough, when they thought to look in the \"new prescriptions\" file, it was there.  They then informed me that it would take two days.  I informed them that this was their fault (again, not so much as a call when they couldn't find one of the prescriptions on record...and they had more than a week to make it) and that I needed it that day.  Thankfully realizing this was their fault, they agreed to call me as soon as it was available.  They didn't call me, and I waited around on campus all day before finally going to the pharmacy right before it closed.  Yep, the meds had been ready for hours, but apparently the employees at the Ashe Center can't use a phone.\n\nI won't describe the second incident in detail (since it would make for a long review), but it involved me trying to transfer a prescription to a pharmacy closer to where I lived.  It was only after I did so that the people at the Ashe Center mistakenly told me that the GSHIP insurance wouldn't transfer...because they couldn't look it up on the computer (they acted like this was my fault, which it wasn't, as I found out later).  It took me hours of arguing with people at the Ashe Center and CVS to discover that, yes!  GSHIP does cover prescriptions not filled at the Ashe Center!  The employee at the Ashe Center pharmacy was just too rude, vague, and uninformed to tell me that.   \n\nSo, the moral of this story is: have your prescriptions transferred to somewhere other than the Ashe Center pharmacy.  It costs the same.  The charges won't show up months later on your BAR account.  And, best of all, you won't have to deal with the lines, the lame hours, and the horrible customer service.", "type": "review", "business_id": "EbepMyXgkHxsjtZaaK4e8g"},

I had an appointment scheduled with Tasha and even though I was a few minutes late she was still very welcoming and understanding.  She offered me a beverage or snack while I filled out the new client form, and I greatly accepted.  After I filled out the form, i thought we would head straight back to the room but instead Tasha sat down with me to go over everything and make sure she had a thorough understanding of what look I was going for.  She explained how to care for the lashes, asked about my past experience with having extensions and even went over a possibility of an allergic reaction; I mean, this girl was thorough and not only that she was cracking jokes and had such an amazing personality.\n\nShe took me back to her room and went through the whole set up, explaining everything she was doing from taping my lower lashes down so they wouldn't interfere with the top ones, to how she separates a single lash from all the rest to make sure my own natural lashes wouldn't be pulled out.  The entire procedure was so relaxing I fell asleep!  I woke up when I felt her removing the tape, and she told me to keep my eyes closed, then she would rinse my eyes.  I was a little nervous to see the final product because I was EXTREMELY specific about what I wanted.  Full and long but not unnatural looking and a teeny bit longer on the outside corner of my eyes.  After she rinsed my eyes she gave me a tissue, (she said the glue can be a little stingy at first), and i opened my eyes.  Dun DUN DUUUNNNNN!  I was AMAZED!!  My eyes have never looked more beautiful and it was the EXACT look I wanted.  That girl is super talented and she made sure I was happy with the results saying she had time to fix anything that I may not like, but that was not necessary.  She gave me a mascara brush to use to comb thru them and walked me out. \n\nI'm a bit perplexed as to how someone could have such a different experience with Tasha because she was so genuine with me, but I don't know the other situation I just wanted to share mine.  I made my next appointment, with Tasha of course, and I already know I'm addicted.  I've never gotten SO many compliments on my lashes before and people are shocked when I tell them that they are extensions!!!\n\nI HIGHLY RECOMMEND Tasha.  She was so sweet, even with me being close to a half hour late, and not to mention she is stunning!  I don't think she was wearing a stitch of makeup and she looked like an exotic model.... no exageration.  \n\nThe place itself is so cute and pretty and the rest of the staff seemed pleasant.

He is very funny, competent, sharp, honest, passionate and enthusiastic with his practice, etc. At the very beginning of our meeting, he made it very clear to me that both of my jaws would need surgery in order to correct my overbite issues. His daughter, Patti, is the one of the nurses also did an excellent job on explaining the procedures in details. Although my surgery was a very big deal and sounded scary and complicated, he had done a total outstanding and  amazing job with it (I came out of the surgery room safe and sound). The recovery time was much shorter than I expected. He definitely had made very sure that I was fine before releasing me from the hospital. For those know will go to him for jaw surgery, just keep in mind that you are in good hand. As long as you follow his words, you will do just fine without hassle and worries. FYI, I had my jaw surgery back in the middle of December 2008. Right now, I look much better, eat better, and feel better with the correct bite.

Other reviewers have accused Zingerman's of using \"above-average\" ingredients, but that is inaccurate, and misses the point entirely. They use the best ingredients that can be found--cost be damned--and pass these ingredients and their cost on to you.\n\nThe sandwiches are awesome. They all pack a huge flavor punch, and the flavor is good, real good. This is a foodie's paradise.  The only criticism I could level is that there are really no subtle sandwiches on the menu. All the one's I've tried come at you with in-your-face flavor, which you do have to be in the mood for.\n\nFor me, though, the sandwiches are less than half of the equation. The gourmet foodstuffs they sell here comprise the best curated stock I have ever seen, anywhere, period. There may be a food shop this good in New York, Chicago, or Boston, but I've spent a lot of time in those cities and I've never seen it. Dozens of jellies, jams, olive oils, vinegars (balsamic, white wine, sherry, etc.), honeys, mustards, hard to find herbs and spices, Spanish almonds, perfect peanuts, etc., etc., etc. I haven't even started on the meats and breads, which are just as good. And this is in Ann Arbor.\n\nThat said, you are going to pay and pay hard for this stuff. When you can find the same thing somewhere else, it's generally 10-20% less. The problem is finding it. And Zingerman's does make up for this little tariff of theirs by letting you sample almost anything in the shop. In fact they almost make you try their food. It's hard to leave without being offered something to eat.\n\nZingerman's combined with Monahan's Seafood, Sparrow Meat Market, and Bello Rosso (for wine, beer, and produce) make Ann Arbor the best food town I've ever lived in, which is all the more impressive since I've lived in cities 30 times its size.\n\nWhen price is absolutely no object and you want the best food on the planet, head to Zingerman's.", "type": "review", "business_id": "fQ8c9S6jitKS5RT6S-ziGA"},

It's my first review, so props to me =]*  I reckon that since I've been using Yelp's services for so long, I might as well give a little bit back.\n\nHave you heard about molecular gastronomy?  It's like the hottest 'new' thing in the culinary world, with chefs using scientific techniques to create new flavour experiences.\n\nEVOO doesn't do that -- the food is pretty solid on its own.  7 of us went for Restaurant Week, when most restaurants are only OK.  But service was spectacular and nowhere was there any indication that our food was any worse than it would have been during a regular week..\n\nFirst, the appetizer.  Four of us had the \"Shy Brother's Cloumage-Filled Batter Fried Verrill Farm's Squash Blossom with Pesto Dressed Zucchini 'Noodles'\".  Personally, it wasn't my favourite -- the zucchini noodles were not paricularly exciting, and parts of the squash were kind of bitter.  But the cloumage was delectable and the batter gave it a nice crunch.\n\nTwo of us had the \"Pat's Wellfleet Littleneck Clams Steamed with Dick's Corn, Smoked Ham of Pete and Jen's Pig, Basil, Garlic, and White Wine\".  And the last one had \"Grilled 'n' Chilled Local Farmer's Summer Vegetable Gazpacho with Striped Bass Belly - Charred Corn Salad\".  Apparently bass belly is rather tough and non-fatty.  Who knew?\n\nIf you thought the appetizers had long names, just wait till you see the entrees.\n\nI had the \"Turf in Surf: Crisp Fried Spciy Chicken Sausage Stuffed Chesapeake Bay Soft Shell Crab with Roasted Pepper - Potato Salad, Grilled Dick's Corn Salsa and Mustard Mayonnaise\".  It was really clever -- a turf IN surf, where the breading enveloped both the chicken sausage and the soft-shell crab into a funny-looking thing that you would expect to find at the bottom of an aquarium.  The salad was also really good -- just the right amount of creaminess but with a lot of variety in the vegetables.  Succulence.  Five stars.\n\nPretty much all the entrees were successful.  Two of my friends got scallops -- but the star of that dish were actually the uber-fresh vegetables.  And one of them got the top sirloin (with zucchini), which was unfortunately way too tough.  He asked me how it was four minutes after I ate it.  I was still eating it.  That was the only sour note.\n\nAnd the desserts!  OMG.  Cue Vanessa Williams' \"Save the Best for Last\".  I think I'll pull it up on YouTube right now.\n\nChocolate truffle cake with (seared?) marshmallow.  Thick and heavy, but full of chocolatey goodness.  Five stars.\n\nApple and blueberry crisp and almond ice cream.  There was something funny in there, not necessarily the tastiest but certainly not bad and definitely made the dish interesting.  Four and a half stars.\n\nAnd I had the corn cake with blueberry compote.  Who makes a deconstructed dessert?  EVOO does!  It actually tasted like corn on the cob.  Yet it was flaky.  Like certain people who didn't show up for dinner (um ... first Yelp friend?  Please still accept my friend request, or whatever we do on this site.).  Four and a half stars.\n\nAnd that very thing you're looking for -- the one thing you can't see?**  ZUCCHINI ICE CREAM.  A boy can dream.\n\nThere were at least six choices for each course, and all of them were presented and executed ABCD.  I'm giving it 5 stars because of the overall atmosphere -- and yeah, service was great.  The food was definitely above average, and while it's not like a 'sticks-in-your-memory-as-the-coolest-bestest-most-amazing-dinner-I've-ever-had-in-my-life\" kind of place, I would consider coming back.

The softness of the latter was really enjoyable as taste treats go. Allows for the hearty flavor to rush in unrestrained. The dominant member of Team Crunchy was the hazelnut. Considering how I'm used to honey-roasted walnuts as a salad nut this was a refreshing switch in both appearance and texture on the tooth. \nThe presentation was inviting. Mounds of spinach with the stems still on. At least you could say you got your greens, right? The honey-balsamic vinaigrette it came with was robust. Not cloyingly sweet.

Their pepperoni is great, but I prefer the other two. \n\nThis place is more crowded than Pino's, and it's smaller as well.

The grand piano looks tiny just floating in one corner of the room.\n\nBeyond the living room, there is also a business center with plentiful desks and some conference rooms, the courtyard itself with lots of tables for your afternoon meeting, and the Alumni Cafe with its decent lineup of food and beverages.\n\nI believe the building's upstairs are filled with offices for both the Alumni Association and Office of Development. Not a bad place to come to work every day.\n\nOverall, the Center is a better place to work than the lobby of a Four Seasons... and when you squint a little and get into your work (or book or lounging), you can drift into a dream of being back at home on Stanford campus, but with the beer smells of dorm life replaced with the lavender scent of an Atherton estate.", "type": "review", "business_id": "D8P3R9QhFcwzRGkEQl63_g"},

I've been waiting for a pole dancing studio like Boston Pole Fitness to open in this city for several years now. I took pole dancing classes several years ago, but had not had any instruction in over 2 years until Stacy opened her studio. This is EXACTLY what I have always wanted. It's the best pole dancing workout I've gotten in Boston and it focuses more on the athletic, the pole tricks, et al. \n\nStacy and Wendy are great instructors. Unbelievably talented. They really know their stuff and you definitely get one-on-one instruction. They make sure you're warmed up, that you learn proper form and alignment, and that you do both sides. When I was doing pole dancing workouts before, I never learned my left side. Up until now, I did not think I had enough coordination to do it but guess what? I totally can! \n\nAnother big plus is class and studio size. Located on the first floor of Gold's Gym on Landsdowne, the space is an excellent size and they make sure the number of poles = number of girls. When you have to share, you just don't learn as well. Also -- the class length. Classes are 1:15. I've always felt an hour is just too short. This might just be personal preference, but if you've ever take a pole class, you might agree. When I leave, my butt has been thoroughly whipped and it is awesome.\n\nIf you've ever been curious about pole dancing as a workout, you have to try a class at Boston Pole Fitness.", "type": "review", "business_id": "mz6OsakkQjwO7IrBwtk-0Q"},

Yes, if you drive you must park in the Kendall Square parking garage, but it's a very short walk and not outstandingly expensive for Cambridge.

If you're not sure what to order, you can always ask them (Tina is very helpful) what they recommend.

So fresh and delicious!)\nCrab Rangoon - never had better\nOrange Chicken\nBasil Eggplant\nsoup of some kind, they're all pretty good\nsmoked chicken \nCrispy Tofu!!! People try to copy their recipe, but the original is still, after all these years, unbeatable!\n\nService in my opinion is always great. If you're going to gripe about cleaning your own table or writing down your order on a piece of paper (it just makes the ordering and cooking process faster - win for everyone), then don't eat here.

All the things a cupcake should be becomes apparent upon first bite.  The look of the cupcake is even appealing.  You can see the chic modern spin on such an old fashioned treat.  The frosting is swirled around flatly creating an edged dome appearance.  And the little candied logo on top adds all the minimalist love one could ask for.\n\nThe ingredients used show off their potential over that of mass produced cupcakes found elsewhere.  The cake itself retains moisture (even over night) and fluffiness.  Yet, it isn't so moist that it seems raw or comes off as overly 'cakey' - instead its fresh, playfully spongy and packed with delicate sweetness that won't overpower your taste buds.  It compliments the frosting laying on top of it perfectly and creates of collage of taste and sweetness with subtle flavors through out, each unique to the flavor of cupcake you choose.\n\nYes, there will be a line, but it will be worth the wait.  Plus, as Sprinkles expands its wonders and opens more locations I am sure that the lines will slowly shorten.  It's still new in La Jolla and there are plenty of people that still haven't heard of it yet, so I'd predict long lines for at least another two to three months as word of mouth spreads like poppy.\n\nAgain, the wait is worth it.  In reality it moves quickly too.  Just be smart about and don't go when you know you need to be somewhere or have major obligations, and go with a buddy so you have something to do as you wait.  Have a chat, or grab a coffee somewhere as you waddle close to sweet success.  \n\nWhat's great about this business is that they offer certain cupcakes on certain days which will appeal to most cupcake lovers as they'll come across that 'challenge' mentality - \"I'm going to try them all!!\" \n\nThey also have staples within the menu which is a great way to start on your cupcake journey.\n\nEnough words already, stop reading and start eating.  Just admit you're in a line for a cupcake, shell out the 3.50 (or more) and enjoy the goodness that is.", "type": "review", "business_id": "roEQNfyPi3jRv3WFFr-f_g"},

At first it was a general quest for what type of business would open, then when it was known to be a restaurant the excitement grew, once we heard it was a wine bar/small plates stalking went into overdrive (including google searches and daily walk bys). \n\nEver since i've lived in this neighborhood, which is only about a year and a half, I have been complaining that there's just nothing exciting way up here to give my friends a reason to visit. Also, the only place to stop in and have some wine and apps/small plates is Sip, which is teensy weensy. \n\nThose days have changed, well maybe in one small instance. Vareli lives up to the hype aesthetically and size-wise. It's a fairly large restaurant, encompassing two floors: the downstairs a mix of the bar and hightops (around barrels) as well as seats for meals, the upstairs another bar and more dinner seating, plus a small outside area with standing room only. It's very pretty, definitely old-world Mediterranean style decor. This is a place you can come for date night meals or just for a glass of wine with the girls, and i'm looking forward to both. \n\nDuring grand opening night we had dinner, the menu while not completely generic was not out of the scope of  Mediterranean menu regulars. The chefs here aren't trying to reinvent the wheel or get a Michelin star, but still deliver on good upscale(ish?) food. There's a mix of cheese plates, meat plates, small plates, salads, burgers (which look amazing staring at the table next to us) and entrees. Something for every occasion while they figure out their niche. \n\nThe two of us split the mussels, cauliflower, tuna tartar small plates, the mahi mahi entree and the chocolate mousse dessert. Nothing blew us away or was exceptional to speak of, but all were pleasant and certainly worth a recommendation to others. \n\nthe wine list on the menu was fairly small and didn't have bottles, i'm wondering if there was a stronger list floating around. The draft and beer list was fine as well. I'd love to see this restaurant flesh out a nice strong beer list both in size and scope (as i'm told the owners come from the westside market at 110th and they themselves have a decent beer selection) and wine list. \n\nPerhaps if this was a different neighborhood the review would be more same old, same old, however in this neighborhood it's a different landscape and therefore a much stronger appreciation and star rating.

I took come from the northeast (CT originally, home to the great New Haven apizzas), and have lived a few years in NYC.  Moving to the Midwest was extremely disappointing in terms of the pizza.  Great deep dish, because that's the Midwest thing, but cannot seem to do a REAL thin crust to save their lives.  I have no idea   why.  I quested all summer all over Chicago to find good thin crust.  So many places advertise \"NY style\" pizza.  For whatever reason, though, they cannot seem to get the crust right, and really, it's all about the right crust, and not too much sauce.  Suffice to say, I have yet to find good thin crust in Chicago. So, then I moved to A2. I continued my quest.  Literally, the first place I tried was NYPD.  I just wanted to walk up to a joint and order a slice (something that is apparently also not done often in the Midwest... those damn deep dish pizzas take so long to make, and you can't even hold it with your hands!) Whenever I try new pizza I find you've got to start with the plain cheese to make the proper comparison to other pizza places.  So I ordered a slice of plain cheese.  It was delish! Good, thin crust (you're supposed to be able to fold it in half and eat it), great cheese, and not too much sauce.  The crust isn't completely perfect, but at least they got the idea, and it definitely would pass for good pizza back home.  \n\nThe other thing I like about the place are the people who run it.  I believe it's a family run business (at least it seems that way, right down to the little old Italian woman who takes orders on a busy Saturday after the football game).  According to the website the originators came from Italy and spent time working in the biz in NYC prior to the family expanding and spreading to A2.  It's no wonder they know how to actually do a NY style pizza, legitimately.  \n\nI noticed several Yelpers claimed the place to be pricey.  Something I've found about a lot of reviews of places around here is that I can't trust native Midwesterners comments' about prices.  Coming from the Northeast my conception of what is \"pricey\" appears to be pretty different from Midwesterners' conception of what \"pricey\" is.  I do not think NYPD is pricey at all.  I think it's quite fairly priced, actually.  Right before moving to A2 I moved from Boston (another place that struggles with pizza) and what they charge for a large cheese I would consider pricey compared even to what you pay for a large cheese in CT or NY. \n\nSo, bottom line. Good pizza. Good people. Good prices. Done.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KEbV_mwq3hO8ryxhUhJ9Eg"},

She is super friendly and sweet.  But more importantly, she listened to what I wanted, clearly told me what she planned to do to my hair to address my needs and lastly did a great job on my hair.  In case you are curious, I had crazy split ends in uneven spots and asked Kaytee to fix the hot mess as well as give me a more contemporary cut that required little maintenance.  She not only was up for the challenge but also offered complimentary maintenance on my layers, if they got too heavy.

I hate being uncomfortable in a place that is supposed to beautify me.  \n\nThe only reason it's 4 stars is because as much as I appreciate the ambiance, the convenient free parking and the comfort of knowing my hair was in good hands, I still have a hard time justifying spending *that* much on a haircut.  The cuts start at $75 for women.  I didn't ask but I also wasn't told how much a cut would be with Katyee...it ended up being $85.    And to be clear 4 stars is a great rating - it's \"Yay! I'm a fan.\"  If I gave it 5 stars (\"Woo hoo! As good as it gets!\") then the cuts would be just a tad less....and actually, I bet you'd get more frequency at a little lower rate.

I fell in love. And then when I was walking on Telegraph and noticed a sign that said Maoz was coming, I was so excited. I wonder what made them choose Berkeley for their West Coast debut. But whatever; it's here and people love it. I don't think the falafel is that particularly amazing (Sunrise Deli beats it by a long shot!) but I think the whole idea of a custom made pita with a bunch of toppings is appealing. \n\nBeware though - it sounds healthy at first but if you get the large pita with the eggplant and hummus combo (with a LOT of amazing Belgian fries), you will undoubtedly suffer from a food coma. I suggest the half pita with no eggplant and hummus and only fries if you're feeling in the mood to splurge. And if you really want to splurge - dip the fries in their mayonnaise (the true Belgian way). It doesn't taste like regular mayo; it has a slight kick to it and is not a gross texture like the mayo you buy from a grocery store. \n\nThe salad bar is also really good - although if you are taking your falafel to go, you cant really add more toppings after you get through the first few bites. I really like the cole slaw topping, the cucumber and tomato mixture, and the roasted peppers. The tahini sauce is also a must!\n\nOverall, this place is tasty, has good service, is very clean (the salad bar is wiped and replenished so often you feel like you are the first one to take from it), and is affordable. A good addition to the Telegraph slump.", "type": "review", "business_id": "17PRKve78GgzlHYdEbK7TQ"},

They have a \"cheap/student menu\" which included decent size portions but is not nearly the value of a buffet.\nI ordered the chicken tikki sandwich at the waitress's recommendation. \nThe naan was excellent. tandoor chicken was also great. The sandwich is decent sized as well. Maybe its just me, but I thought the curry sauce was slightly odd in flavor and didn't mix too well with the lettuce and other veggies in the sandwich. I asked for some of their chutneys to finish the naan off with and was disappointed. The \"green one\" was too minty and lumpy with a slightly sour taste-I suspect it was going bad. I wasn't brought any others (most Indian places usually bring 2 or 3). I decided to try some kheer (rice pudding) to test an additional dish. This had a \"lemony\" flavor- evidence that it too had gone bad. I should have complained and asked for it to be taken off my bill but I was studying for a test and in a hurry so I chose not to finish it and just pay and leave. Again this is my own fault for paying full price, but I write this for future customs to be aware of. The waitress didn't seem to notice I had hardly eaten any of the rice pudding and didn't ask if there was a problem. I don't expect this from this type of restaurant, although considering she wasn't busy noticing this would have helped gain points for exceptional service. I'm not sure I would have even been able to have this conversation anyways, I had difficulty even asking her for the sauces (language barrier?)\n\noverall: \nany time food has gone bad is a minus in my book. some of the other food was great, but without buffet or great deals I wont be going back, despite the fact that its a block from class.

However, if you must serve plastic cheese and dog-food quality meat, can you at least make it taste okay?  Border Cafe pales in comparison to Taco Bell.\n\nAnyone considering walking in should turn around and head straight to Felipe's, Chipotle, or even CVS for a frozen burrito.", "type": "review", "business_id": "pvlM--HZY1a8SqMXiwEz1A"},

It's a special occasion only place, but fiance and I decided to finally celebrate our engagement and went here for dinner.\n\nThe atmosphere is nice, service was friendly, if slightly over-attentive, but I'd prefer that to bad service any day. The atmosphere was somehow relaxed and romantic at the same time. I love the decor.\n\nWe had the okra and a scallop sashimi dish for appetizers. For entrees, I ordered the special Korean Fried Chicken with potato salad, Peter got the pork lettuce wraps. Dessert, I got the figs with creme fraiche ice cream, Peter got the hot chocolate cake with hazelnut ice cream. Finally, for drinks I got the Late Blossom and he got the Dark and Stormy. With the exception of my cocktail, I've order everything again. The fried chicken was especially delicious. I'm notoriously picky about chicken, I do pretty much boneless skinless breasts. I ate this off the bone, no problem. No weird bits, nothing gross, just amazingly tender and flavorful meat. The batter and spice were divine.I'll have dreams about this chicken. My cocktail was good enough, but nothing about it stood out to me. It was mildly sweet. I couldn't even say it tasted like anything in particular.\n\nI'll be back and as soon as possible too.

Anyone who works in the restaurant industry needs to have this place investigated for how they cook their food and treat their cusomters, or be on the look out to stay away. The huge problem of course is dealing with making people tip. This is not something they understand very well because there is no law that requires tipping, but they seem to think that. The service with their attitude is horrible as well. \n\nI ate there a few times and always ordered the same dish, well as time went on they kept changing what went in the dish and when I would ask for the original items in the dish, they would deny ever having put them in there. I was surprised by that reaction. It was that only dish that kept me going back because it was so good, but it was the waitresses and owner that has kept me away, because they would always push about not tipping. The first times I did, but after they got sloppy on their service and food, I stopped, which turned into a shouting match of explaining that I don't have to tip. The lady kept hounding me about it and threated to add on a service charge of 15% for not tipping. I warned her if that if I saw it on my statement, she would be looking at a fine and that I would report them to the Texas Restaurant association, At which point the lady stopped talking and didn't say another word. If they give you hassle about removing a charge or reducing a price and ask for any personal IDs you should tell them no and that they should not be asking for that information in the first place. If you use a credit card, watch what amount they actually charge you because they like to add on little fees if they think you were a bad customer.\n\nI truely believe this place needs to be investigated for their business practices. They are very rude and do not provide proper service, food, and cleanliness. If anything, get rid of the owners and bring in new people. I know that is not realistic but the food is good just not the people who run it. If there is rich business man out there who reads this, please buy up this place, get rid of the owners, shut it down, renovate the place, fix it up and then re-open so people can enjoy this place in peace, and not worrying about getting fined or taxed for asking for too much or looking at them wrong.\n\nIf nothing is done to stop how they run their place, then sooner or later it will turn into the soup naiz's place, where the owner can ban anyone at will and you can only order certain things and if you complain, you're kicked out, just like they sorta do now.\n\nThis place really needs to change. and as some people have already stated, this place doesn't even deservce one star. If this post helps keep people away from this place then it will have done its job and saved a life (lives). Besides, there are other great Thai places around austin without the attitude problem.", "type": "review", "business_id": "IyZsBKYIWMiXSg5OpN5rEQ"},

They sell unique European wedding dresses that you won't find anywhere else.  They are decently priced, as far as wedding dress go.  Expect to pay $800 - $2000 for a dress; they are a mid-range dress shop after all.  \n\nThe staff is amazing and some of the most helpful people I have ever met.  I got my wedding dress from them, they altered it there, were able to take it to a cleaner they do business with for me, and kept the dress in the shop until I was ready to take it home.  They even let me borrow a petty coat so I didn't have to buy it on top of everything else.  It was great to just go to one shop and not have to go anywhere else for cleaning and alterations.  \n\nThey only stock one of each dress, and while you can order one in your size if it is too small, I feel the best part is knowing that you have a dress that no one else is going to have.  No, you aren't going to show up at your wedding and see a woman wearing the same dress as you, you never are, but the benefit to this over someplace like David's Bridal is that you can get something that isn't your run of the mill, mass produced wedding dress that doesn't cost $5000+.  The fact that the staff starts to learn your name as you come in over the year before your wedding makes things very personal.\n\nThe owner of the shop also stocks and makes some of her own evening wear, mother of the bride dresses, and flower girl dresses.  If it weren't for the fact that I'm still a student and living off of student loans, I would totally be in there all the time buying dresses to wear on the town or on a cruise.  Expect the non-bridal dresses to cost about $300 - $600 dollars, and no, they aren't poofy.  I've seen a lot of girls go into the shop for a prom dress.  I would much rather have a prom dress from here than the prom dress I had senior year that was a poof nightmare and set my mom back $500.  I still don't know why my mom bought me that dress....", "type": "review", "business_id": "l7M-ZBXptxbIn7PXz4lR8Q"},

In fact, I have driven up to Portsmouth specifically for the Friendly Toast.  SO, I was happily surprised when I learned from a friend that a Cambridge version of an old favorite had recently opened.  \n\nThe first reviews I read of the Cambridge Friendly Toast referenced the restaurant size (small) and cost (high).  This gave me some early skepticism.  Additionally, I often find that the charm of any restaurant is a combination of the menu, atmosphere (inner and outer), and other factors that are challenging to duplicate.  With those reservations in mind, we headed to Kendall Square on a sunny Saturday afternoon.   \n\nWhen we entered the restaurant I noticed the decor was definitely striving for a similar feel to the Portsmouth location, though in a forced sort of way.  Not painfully so, however.  The bar and \"lounge\" seating area are nice touches as we definitely had a wait when we got there.  With the timing (saturday) and perfect spring weather, we ended up waiting a good 30+ minutes for a table.  It didn't necessarily feel long, though as there was plenty of space to sit it out.  There were larger groups that seemed to have waited longer and were enjoying some interesting mixed drinks from the bar.  \n\nOnce we were finally seated, I did find the restaurant to be more spacious than I initially expected.  Others complained about the hipster servers, though you would sort of expect it with the decor.  As everyone there was polite and friendly, the hipster factor didn't bother me so much.  As far as the food, I ordered Kate's Tofu Scramble with home fries.  It was essentially a tofu omelette with corn, mushroom and fake sausage.  It was delicious.  Seriously.  The bread was thick and tasty too.  Overall it was more than enough food that was too much to finish.  \n\nMy final analysis is that the Friendly Toast is a great addition to Cambridge, and especially Kendall Square, a place I rarely have reason to visit.  The downsides are a possible wait and some challenges with parking, though those are pretty minor and expected inconveniences for good food.........", "type": "review", "business_id": "yx4IYpg9MGbrVqNdZwXX_A"},

I've encountered a few other expired things too - drinks mostly.  Basically they buy a bunch of shit at the start of the quarter and let everything run down until the quarter ends, so if you see something you like early in the quarter you'd have to just buy them up and keep your own little inventory at your place.

Being a vegetarian, I enjoy eating somewhere that offers an herbivore selection which goes beyond  a salad, soup, bean burger, and a veggie wrap.  Here you can't find a salad that does not include a meat option, they do not offer a bean burger at all, but they do boast a vegetarian soup each day.  The last few times I have eaten here I opted for the Georgia Reuben minus turkey, plus tomato (a customized go-to veggie option of mine), and each time the wait staff have given me an odd look before walking away--you're in Ann Arbor, what can you expect?  \n\nOn another note, I will preface this by saying I am fairly tolerant when it comes to a smokey environment.  In fact, when it comes to a good bar/pub, I think this to be an important component.

But it's hard to compare large-scale places such as REI to something only as big as Whole Earth(even though I know it's got multiple stores in multiple cities). \n\nLong live local, and the mom and pop shops!", "type": "review", "business_id": "7gSYPLX_0o0By_AybMT62g"},

When my husband and I were looking for wedding venues in the Capital District, we were referred to The Franklin Plaza by a relative who had recently been to someone else's wedding there. He boasted about the food and how pretty the reception room was, so we decided to check it out (knowing that we had basically decided on another venue already). \n\nSince we live in NYC, we made a quick call to see if there was a way we would be able to come see the space that weekend. We spoke with Joe, who came in for a special appointment on a Sunday morning with us. We were floored the second we walked into the space. An old federal savings bank, this place has the rich history and grandeur you would imagine, but with a charm and beauty that look my breath away. Joe was incredible - walking us through every detail of the way the ceremony would be set up, the HOUR-AND-A-HALF cocktail hour upstairs with 15 passed hors d'oeuvres, 4 stationary tables, and open bar, and then the reception downstairs with a four-course dinner, including dessert course and more open bar. And, their hotel is right across the street - none of our guests would have to drive anywhere. We were sold. Especially when we found out that they were actually cheaper than some of the other places we had been looking at previously. \n\nOur wedding day was PERFECTION. I work as an event planner, so I am used to managing every detail of event days myself. The folks at the Franklin Plaza took care of absolutely everything. There was never a question in my mind that our wedding would be anything less than exquisite. The head waiters and site managers were incredible, and we had everything we needed taken care of for us all night. I didn't have to lift a finger. The food was incredible. You could really tell that Michael's catering (through the Franklin Plaza) was truly a chef and caterer, not just your run-of-the-mill event venue cranking out the typical steak, chicken, fish. They did every single meal to order, served every one of my 180 guests in record time, and kept everyone happy - and FULL - all night long. \n\nThere is honestly not a bad thing I could possibly say about this venue. I would suggest that anyone looking for a terrific venue for their wedding, bar Mitzi, anniversary party, ANYTHING visit the Franklin Plaza. If you ever get an invitation for an event at the Franklin Plaza, go! Even if you don't even like the person inviting you. Go anyway to check out this incredible place and have an amazing experience like I had. It's that good.", "type": "review", "business_id": "YVDfVKznxZpDDkk_Lor-1w"},

The stores I go to in the Bay Area and the LA area all carry the same exact products I tend to watch the prices for at a rough average of two to three dollars less.  I get that location/climate/distribution affects produce prices but for pantry items there's no justification for such a price difference.\n\n2. Rude service at the food counters.\n\n3. Because there's not much in the way of eating/shopping around UCSD except for the retail complex in which this Whole Foods is located, the parking situation here is ridiculously crowded/stressful/dangerous.\n\n4. This is the first Whole Foods where I've seen flyers for a pseudoscientific seminar/class on \"the link between gluten and autism.\"  Never mind that a large review of the major studies on the very issue have debunked the idea of a link between gluten (or casein) and autism; this Whole Foods seems to be actively promoting the idea anyway.  There's nothing in it for Whole Foods, right?  They're just doing it because they care about the consumer and not because they're trying to sell their insanely priced gluten-free baked goods and rice breads, right?  Hmm.  Hmmmmmm.\n\nThe reason you're not seeing a one-star rating is because there's really no other place in the general UCSD area for healthy, affordable prepared meals as all the restaurants are either of the crappy chain/mall variety or just overpriced, hotel-adjacent wastes of time.  Pretty much the only place in the area to get quality food at a reasonable price is at the salad bar and hot food/deli counters at this Whole Foods.

Looked like a BIG mistake.  There were at least 30 people in line in front of us.  And a few fire fighters on the side.  (huh?  I guess if cops can hang around doughnut places, fire-fighters can hang out at frozen yogurt places, right?)\n\nThis odd reality is that it took us less than 5 minutes to sift through such a considerably big line.  And this was just a little before 10pm.  I thought the crowd would have thinned out by now.  The thing is, they don't thin out.  Maybe students don't have lives.  Duh.\n\nTheir yogurt is yummy.  It is very ice-cream like.  It tasted great.  and when it melts...it reminds me of Asian yogurt drinks.  The tiny kind that are as tall as my finger, with the peel-off metal top.  lol.  Good times.\n\nDid I mention a good choice of toppings?  I got a lot of gummy bears too.  he heh heh.\n\nThe person that helped us?  She was awesome.  Everything was answered with a polite and enthusiastic YES.  Where can you find that nowadays?  And from someone young?  hmmmm.

Normally, I refer to Yelp for assistance in finding good places to eat or drink when I'm on the road.  But on my recent trip to Seattle, I found myself needing coffee after arrival from my 6 am departure flight.  Just a ways across the street from the hotel I was staying in was Trabant.  The concierge of the hotel suggested I get my needed dose of legalized stimulant from Trabant and proclaimed in a school girl way how much she loved their chai.\n\nNot being a fan of chai, of any sort, I did not have high expectations.  I resigned myself to an average cup of coffee and figured I could look for truly good coffee places online, when I had the time.  This was Seattle, after all.  What I didn't expect, but what I did in fact receive, was one of the best cups of coffee I've ever had.  Those super-duper Clover machines really do brew good coffee.  Ethiopian sidamo was good and, for a sweeter drink, I liked the Mexican mocha.  \n\nI wound up dropping in every morning that I was in Seattle.  Nice place for a cup of coffee, armed with the morning paper or if you want to look over your emails for the day.", "type": "review", "business_id": "U-R1wp_wCawilyq8b45vPg"},

I liked the name, I like the comfortableness and somewhat hip feel of the place.  The waiters, waitress's are all young, attractive and pleasant.  Food is acceptable.  I thought the prices were a little high for mediocre food.\n\nI had one issue here.  We came in at 6:01-6:02...and I told the waiter that we would have the 2 for 1 Oysters as appetizers ONLY if we could get the 2 for 1 price (which ended at 6PM).  He said...\"Ummmm...I'll have to check, because it ends at 6PM.\"  Well, cuz you know oysters are expensive\n\nBeing only a few minutes past 6...I figured he could work it out.  And if he COULD make it happen, then we would like a big plate of Oysters......if not, then we would not want any oysters.\n\nI figured if it was a question of giving us the order for half price...or not ordering them at all, the manager would rather see us run up our bill....than skip the appetizers altogether.\n\nHe brought the big plate of oysters and I figured he came thru for us.  Yay!\n\nWell, the bill came, and I realized that he had charged me full price.  When I questioned this, he said \"I checked and was told that we couldn't offer the half-price since it was a couple of minutes past 6\".  Which is fine, but I wouldn't have ordered them otherwise.  I asked my tablemates if I was clear when I spoke to him, and they all remember me saying to skip it if we could get the 1/2 price offer.\n\nNot wanting to get into a to-do over it with a group of people....I simply deducted the amount of the discount I was expecting from his tip.  (And I usually tip well.)  I figured I wasn't going to pay for this...and since it was his fault, he was.\n\nI can't tell if this was a simple misunderstanding...or a waiter trying to \"pull something\".\n\nI would go there again, but again, go over the bill item by item.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bf-6Bh9gM6gEJHr4tdd7iA"},

Also one of the few attempts at authentic Mexican food on this side of the city.\n\nPersonally have been to Zocalo a few times, with mixed experiences each time.  The food is on the upper end of decent, with my personal favorite being the chile relleno.  They seem to consistently pick good peppers and the spiced cheese is of a very nice quality, although the same cannot be said about the sides.  The beans routinely seem to be overcooked and the rice way too hard and undercooked.  Very unfortunate, but I guess that the main dish is where they put the most effort.  Students can avail of a 10$ lunch special, which is very very reasonable for a UC eatery with above-average food, and there is also a 25$ prix fixe menu which is a good option for those who aren't too financially constrained.\n\nThe story of the restaurant is nice, with a husband and wife who worked in the food industry for over 30 years outside the city coming together to open their own eatery and serve traditional food.\n\nUnfortunately, the staff seems like they are forced to work there, and this is very evident with the service.  A few are nice, and actually help out with the food selection, but the majority just don't make the cut.\n\nThe bar selection seems to be decent, although I cannot personally comment.\n\nAll in all, decent pricing and above-average food make this place a good visit, and honestly, ymmv, depending on the staff and which chef is there for that day.\n\nGood eats!", "type": "review", "business_id": "Ryt1Fhgz7sixMQSJiLyP_g"},

Six of us sat at a table that should have really held four. It's definitely a place to go with friends, not a date or the like. For what its worth, the walls are a pleasing eggplant colour. If you like eggplants, anyway. \n\nFood: For the amount we paid (none of my friends got anything over 9 bucks, and I don't remember seeing anything over 15 even on the menu) I guess you could say it was worth it. I got the spicy calamari because I'm a seafood maniac. It wasn't spicy at all, although it was cut and cooked in such a way as to resemble flower shapes, which was a nice detail until I bit into a piece and realized that no real flavour made up for the pleasing visual. It was served with a sweet chilli sauce that I distinctly recognized from a bottle I bought at 99 Ranch once, which bothered me especially since it really didn't go with the calamari at all. My friends got Pad Thai, which looked gloppy but serviceable; a vegetable dish that came with rice and actually looked the best out of the bunch, with fresh vegetables (!); pan fried noodles, something involving pork, and some other noodle thing. Yeah, it's a noodle place and if you want your fix of basic thai noodles for around 7 bucks you'll get what you're looking for. \n\nService: This is what REALLY brought it down for me. Not only did it take forever for our order to be taken and for the server to realize four waters wouldn't be enough for six people, when the check arrived it was about 60 something... which we quickly realized is impossible when no one ordered anything above 9 dollars, even with tax and the 15% service charge already added. Somehow they added ten dollars to our bill. When my friend took it up to ask them about it, they just took the receipt and retyped it out without an apology. I get that you're all quite busy, but ten extra dollars on a bill that was only 50 dollars to begin with? Really? \n\nIt was a Friday night dinner with friends, but I wouldn't recommend this place for a relaxing evening, really. Maybe if you're heading home from classes and really need a pad thai takeaway fix, it's good, but... the noise and slow, inattentive service really made it a place I was happy to leave.", "type": "review", "business_id": "yUcJph0JNzbdQnrkXjb38g"},

When he finally showed up, he had to check with the chef where our meals were.  After everyone who sat around us had finished their meals, we finally got ours.  There were only three ravioli and the shrimp tasted like it had sat around and then was reheated in the microwave--overcooked.

How in the world can the ultra mediocre Bombay Coast in the Price Center get 4 stars when Hi Thai has only two? I wonder if it's because UCSD students are more familiar with Southeast Asian cuisine and therefore are more critical of it?\n\nI'm not saying Hi Thai is brilliant -- keep in mind that they're an on campus eatery, and expectations are automatically lower -- but I think they're worth three stars (\"A-OK\" in Yelp-speak) for food, eating space, and convenience to my classes. And I'm adding an extra star to make up for all the haters.\n\nI honestly think the food is rather tasty. I come here when I want a break or am craving some Asian food (Panda Express doesn't count...). I get more meat in my sandwiches here than I do at K Sandwiches, and I gotta say I prefer Hi Thai's (I'm going to get some haters for that comment). It's one of the cheapest meals you can get on campus, with a sandwich for approximately $4.08, including tax. \n\nPlus, their other dishes (say, curry chicken) provides a lot of food and are a great value -- more than most on-campus outlets. They've got a big variety of food -- sandwiches, rice dishes, fried noodles, noodle soups -- and I hear they're now serving breakfast (from 8am onwards). \n\nI'm not going to lie, I don't love everything on the menu. I dislike their bright-orange pad thai, their iced tea isn't great either. But the BBQ pork noodles are great. When I'm having a bad day I go for beef curry over rice, which comes with a small fried wonton (eh) and a green salad. Their coconut soup with tofu is an appetizer that works great as a light meal. Their meat isn't the highest quality, but I wouldn't say it's as atrocious as others put it out to be -- I've never had problems with the food quality here. \n\nThey're open lateish -- till 9pm, and have ample space for studying and eating, including a study lounge complete with comfy chairs and a fireplace.\n\nSo there ya go. Hi Thai isn't high-class, it isn't going to knock your socks off, but it will feed ya and feed ya better than most places on campus.  You could do much, much worse at UCSD and it's the best Asian food choice - although Shogun does have beer...", "type": "review", "business_id": "3ukajhh9kfXcLqMGzh_MkA"},

If you're there at a quiet time of day, I do not recommend getting wine by the glass - when I have done so it's tasted a bit old.

Pretty much everything on the menu is under $10, and I really enjoyed the food served. The restaurant isn't very big, and the set-up is such that you order and pay for your food at the register, grab a table, and wait for your food to be brought out. \n\nSince I generally prefer rice dishes over noodles, I usually ordered bi bim bap and some of the other stone pot-based rice dishes served at Koreana. I was particular fond of the Dol Sot Bulgogi, which is rice, bulgogi, kimchi vegetables, and a fried egg, all served in a hot stone pot. The rice that makes contact with the stone pot becomes really nicely charred, especially if you let it sit in the pot for a minute or two after it's served. \n\nI guess the one downside to Koreana is that, unlike larger Korean restaurants, there is no full complement of banchan (little side dishes), which is one of my favorite aspects of dining at Korean establishments. Instead, each meal comes with a small container of kimchi. \n\nKoreana serves good food at reasonable prices. These qualities make it an appealing dining option for the local college crowd, particularly because there are so many Korean students and so few nearby Korean restaurants. While not life-changing, Koreana's food will certainly satisfy a Korean craving, so if you're looking for a quick, cheap, and, most importantly, good meal, than you should check out Koreana.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bdteJqgoj0OaALhj9RFtmw"},

Coming out of the 116th subway stop, I find myself directly in front of their door, so it can't really be any more convenient to stop their on my way home when I need a bottle of wine.\nThe staff is generally very friendly and helpful. They are especially talented at food pairings and are willing to listen to my \"menu\" and then recommend a few wines that would pair well to whatever I might be cooking.\nUpon a recent visit, however, I accidentally took a bottle from their refrigerator and was chastised by the lady working for going against their \"system\". Then the bottle was more than I have paid for it in the past and when I tried to ask her about it, she snapped \"We've never sold this wine for that price\". OK... I'm sure that in her opinion she knew what she was talking about on both points. I don't work there so I can't pretend to be an expert. But as far as customer service goes, it was a bit surprising to be criticized for my actions as I'm handing over my credit card. This is an isolated incident in my experience and I will keep visiting the Winery.

I have never been to Italy, but I have friends who are natives of Italy and I brought them to La Piccoletta just as an experiment - to see what they would say. Their verdict was that both the ambiance and the food makes you feel as though you are at a small lodge/restaurant that makes scrumptious food in the Italian countryside. La Piccoletta is an incredibly delightful place!! \n\nThe warning I shall give anyone visiting this charming restaurant is that you may find it quite hard to appreciate food at other Italian/American-Italian restaurants after enjoying La Piccoletta's fare. \n\nBeing a small restaurant that is open only in the evenings, they limit their menu to dishes that they decide upon every week. Their menu focuses on quality rather than quantity. The options (recently expanded) include dishes like Filet Mignon, Cioppino, Meatballs, servings of antipasto platter, insalata, and their featured pasta and sauces of the week (together with salad and bread). \n\nThey feature a pasta and four or five sauces every week, available all through the week. If you order pasta, you get a plate of pasta and as much and as many sauces as you would like. My favorite sauces are the White Sauce with Peas and the Aromi sauce. Simply Delicious!! \n\nTuesday nights are half-price on a pasta dinner for two ($11 per person with salad, bread and non-alcoholic drink). The same type of dinner is available for college students on Thursday nights for $9.50. Ever since we discovered this place hidden in the parking lot between Indian Hill and Yale Ave last year, my friends and I dine here at least once in two weeks. Needless to say, Tuesday and Thursday nights are our favorite La Piccoletta nights. I believe they also have family specials on Saturdays.\n\nI think they have a neat selection of wines, and they are all reasonably priced per glass or bottle. Their house wines are good quality as well, and you can enjoy a fresh, fine-tasting red or white wine for as low as $3 or $4. I like that they don't empty stale wine into the glasses of those who order their house wine. \n\nWe always order their Tiramisu when we are at La Piccoletta to celebrate an occasion.  I like their other desserts, but their Tiramisu definitely rocks the house!!!  \n\nFinally, always make reservations as the seating area is small and intimate and this place is really popular. I want to give a bonus star to their friendly and considerate staff.  :-) I will move from Claremont next year and will probably really miss this place!", "type": "review", "business_id": "2uf4Swj6fRoZ_WOaaVv8bA"},

When we moved in back in August, there was mold all over the ceiling, walls, and growing in the toilet in our bathroom. We called them to take care of it, but all they did was spray paint over it. A few months later, the mold grew back. Big surprise! We called them again to take care of it. Their response to the situation: \"Well, last time we used our special mold spray, which is supposed to permanently get rid of mold. It looks like it lasted a few months, so that's pretty good.\" I'm sorry, since when are permanently and four months the same thing?! Anyway, it took them over a week to come and take care of something that should be taken care of immediately!!! Now all of our clothes smell like mold and even when we wash them, it's hard to get rid of the smell.\n\nNot only that, but recently we've had problems with a leaky shower. They had someone come in to cut out a huge chunk from the ceiling above our shower to fix the pipe. Now little pieces of drywall are falling into our bathtub and all the moldy pipes are exposed! As he was leaving, he told us that he fixed the pipe, but someone else was going to come to patch up the two feet by one foot hole in our ceiling. Yeah...it's been a week and still no one has come to fix it! I wouldn't mind so much, but now the mold smell in our bathroom is even stronger!!! I'll definitely be contacting the tenant union and health department about this. They've been screwing over students for far too long!", "type": "review", "business_id": "iXhNbqH2oh2MBpXGeqwEVA"},

They are very courteous, but as I witnessed one time, will come over the counter with pots and knives at you if you get out of line. If you are drunk, walk home or call a cab, if you aren't - say hello to the police so they know you are cool and leave you alone when you leave.

I've been eating at Madam Mam's for the last 8 years - even before it was called Madam Mam's (it was just known as Noodles and More then). \nThis is the best thai place in Austin - with only one other place coming close (Titaya - see my yelp on that - if you have nothing better to do...). The only other Thai restaurant that I CRAVE apart from Madam Mam's is on 3rd Avenue (and 28th Street) in NYC - called Jaiya Thai. That's THE best thai  food outside of Thailand (I've been fortunate enough to pig out on Thai food in Thailand - Phuket was my favorite).\nSo - to summarize - if you TRULY love thai food - fly to Phuket. If Phuket is not for you - fly to NYC - catch a cab to Jaiya Thai (3rd and 28th). If NYC is not for you - drive over to UT (spend about 30 mins looking for free parking - or pay to park in the covered tower garage a few steps away from Madam Mam's). Walk over to Madam Mam's for the best Thai food west of New York! ALL THE CURRIES ARE FANTASTIC (this is the only place that can truly do green curry right). If 3 stars spiciness (default for most curries) just doesn't do it for you - try the Jungle curry or the green fish ball curry (5 star chillies). That should open up your nostrils (and your neighbour's as well). \n \n For some kicking noodles - try the Pad Spaghetti Kee Mao (I think F5). For a thick masala type sauce - try the slow cooked beef curry (P44). The entire 'special menu' (P41 through P50) is a treat for your taste buds. Order anything from that list - and you will not be disappointed.\n\nThe chu-chee salmon will make you see salmon in a whole new light. Just a big chunk of fresh salmon in a great tasting red coconut curry. \n\nI can write an individual note on each entree in the menu - but I'll just get hungry in the process...\n\n That's it - I've downloaded ALL my hard-earned Thai cuisine knowledge - for YOUR TASTE-BUDS ONLY!", "type": "review", "business_id": "hTp23z3Q5PCvuGvKTIQtXw"},

You see, when they put the tire back on, they cinched the lug nuts on with the air wrench, which is much faster than a regular old wrench-with-a-handle, but which torques it to three hundred pounds.  Three hundred pounds of torque is a Very Bad Idea.  In the best case, if you get a flat tire, and all you have is the dinky little 12-inch wrench to put the spare on, you're completely fucked unless you weigh 300 pounds and like jumping on wrench handles.  In the WORST case, you are me.  I drive a VW, which has those finicky little locking bolts that require a key to open.  When you apply three hundred pounds of force to that key six months later, it shears in half, leaving you with a bolt that has to drilled out at some expense, and leaving you with three out of four snow tires on your car, which you can barely limp over to the dealership in.  Not a good scene.\n\nSounds like a really cool bunch of guys, but make sure you ask them not to use the air wrench to put your tires back on...", "type": "review", "business_id": "pMEabXhcC43f5YbRwtn4DA"},

I bought a small Shiraleah purse in the sand color.  It was a bit pricey, but I plan on using it a lot so I don't mind TOO much.  \n\nAbout a week later, I shopped around Harvard Square for a pair of nude-colored heels for my graduation.  This is no easy feat for me because my shoe size is 5.5.  Monella, like most stores, did not have a size 5.5 in these patent leather Steve Madden pumps that I wanted.  When the saleslady saw that I really liked them, she offered to call other Monella stores to see if they had the pair in stock.  One location had the shoes and was able to have them sent to the Cambridge shop.  I always appreciate that kind of customer service since my busy schedule does not always allow me to stop by every store in the city for a shoe size that is seldom readily available.", "type": "review", "business_id": "CiCzdCfbq1QFaJNr1DJn7w"},

Up through 1990, Rasputins was THE primary destination for music obsessives who like the cheaper prices of 2nd hand LPs/CDs and an eclectic collection of a wide variety of music that you just can't find in most other places. Rasputins was simply unrivaled, and its great reputation and high standing in the pantheon of great Bay Area record shops seemed cemented. But when Amoeba opened shop down the street, that all began to shift, as Amoeba offered better prices, friendlier and more knowledgeable staff, and slightly more generous amounts of $$$ given to people who sell them their records. Soon enough, Amoeba's increasingly fabulous used selection had the lead  in cool, interesting, sought after vinyl. Within a year of its opening, Amoeba became the record store on Telegraph you'd go to *first*. \n\nNowadays Rasputins is a sad joke. The vinyl selection, in particular, has become a heinously absurd situation. Whoever prices their LPs is either highly delusional or simply on crack. LPs that are grossly overpriced increasingly look as if they've been subjected to a disk sander. I'm sorry, but $17 for a not-that-rare Cocteau Twins or Smiths record that's so badly scratched it's totally unplayable? Who the hell are they trying to fool? (Similar records in crappy condition wouldn't go for more than a few bucks at Amoeba). Hell, it seems anything that Rasputins sells for $5 or less has been used as a cat-scratching post before going out on the shelves. I mean, they've just completely lost touch with reality in this department. \n\nThe used CD selection is also kind of sad. True, the average used CD price seems to have fallen below that of Amoeba's, but the selection has become comparatively thin and uninteresting. \n\nFurthermore, one really gets the sense that Amoeba's staff tends to care more about what they're doing, so that not only are they friendlier, but much more with it in general. Rasputins, by contrast, now seems only to hire jaded, aloof, unknowledgeable college kids to augment the staff of ancient burn-outs who've been there since the 70s. \n\nBasically, Amoeba surpasses Rasputins in every way, and has continued to do so for over 15 years. Throughout this time, Rasputins has made no attempt to catch up, improve its shortcomings, or even acknowledge Amoeba's existence. Blinded by self-importance and a deeply faded legacy, Rasputins stubbornly forges ahead down its sad path of overt mediocrity. \n\nThat said, I do still pop in there now and then and very occasionally find an LP or two sold at a fair price that reflects a connection with reality. But walking out empty-handed has become much more the norm.", "type": "review", "business_id": "DX_lGExgrpRcqPCwnvyhVg"},

Like a good Pavlovian dog I will drool a Saint Bernard under the table if I had access to just one of the dubiously-hygienic 5 gallon buckets of Masala sauce I see the cooks lugging around time to time. This stuff is that good. \n\nThe Lamb is great, the Chana Masala is great, the Aloo Gobi keeps me asking for more. The Tandoor chicken is moist and spicy sweet. Even the free chai tea doesn't taste like crap. \n\nMan I really love this place. But guess what? I've been folded over in half one too many times to give these guys any more of my money, dignity and gastro-intestinal fortitude. No more I say. Unless I see a yellow-orange IV, I say no thank you to Mr. Naan and his wife Mrs. Curry. No thank you sir and ma'am, though tempted I am for your liquid heroin of delicious golden joy, I will not falter. \n\nTo put a nail in the Naan and Curry coffin let me just say that right across the street on Durant, you can find a joint called House of Curries. And guess what? They use the same recipes and you get to keep the food in you for more than 2 hours. I can almost guarantee it. \n\nExact same recipes except for one: the mouth watering, crispy/fluffy, buttery garlicky or oniony, Naan. Yes boys and girls the naan at Naan and Curry is not only unbeatable but unrepeatable even by the wonderful House of Curries. \n\nSo I do bid you all farewell - as it must have been written in the stars, that a wretch of my moral ineptitude and self loathing could not resist another visit, another hit from the golden heroin you call Tikka Masala folded into the perfect naan. So raise your glasses high you fellow experience junkies because I am 215 food poisonings and counting.", "type": "review", "business_id": "xtyK6kDA4A2ASCVuU2vH7A"},

Lots of variety and pretty good prices to boot. But while you might come to enjoy a nice cocktail or a cold beer, the food is really the draw for me on most occasions. \n\nRight off the bat, I just need to say this: Scotty's is home to my favorite order of wings on the planet. I've had several different flavors and they're all superb. I typically go for the traditional BBQ and always leave satisfied. They've got a slight crunch which really makes the perfect wing I think. And for a guy who often complains about the lack of quality in the bleu cheese dipping sauce -- this place does not fail. BIG chunks in there... and I like that. \n\nBut the rest of the menu has been great as well. My brother in law has a higher heat tolerance than I do and just adores anything smothered in their Mo' Fo' sauce. As for me, I typically stick with the wings or one of the sandwiches and top things off with an order of waffle fries (sometimes w/ cajun season, sometimes not). \n\nFor starters, the dill chips and spinach/artichoke dip are the real winners -- but if you like cheese and bacon, you certainly won't be disappointed by the loaded fries. \n\nFrom there, let's skip to the burgers -- the Shewman Special is daunting, but it's as delicious as the idea is ridiculous. Just try it sometime. Takes the best that the XXX has to offer and ups the ante with bacon and jalapenos. \n\nIf you can't do it though, the backyard bar-b-q or blues burger are sure to satisfy. \n\nAnd if you can handle a little heat, go for the Atomic Mo'Fo' -- I hear it's one of the best spicy burgers around. \n\nMy wife has enjoyed a number of the salads and wraps as well, but perhaps prefers the fish tacos most. Beware of the Mo'Fo' mustard though... it's got a surprising amount of kick. \n\nAnd if you're not feeling beer or a drink, definitely try a tall glass of their root beer or a chocolate shake -- both come highly recommended.", "type": "review", "business_id": "h6YJ8ULFYSjVPbe5V9eFuw"},

It was one of those nights that started out great, went awry part way through, then righted itself again.  \n\nI was going there to seeing Sondre Lerche, my favorite Norwegian singer/songwriter, so I was totally pumped.  Combine that feeling with my freshman excitement over never having been to Central Square before (such a mysterious/foreign land to me at the time, now I live there) mixed in with some cheap vodka,(all I had available to me as a pathetic frosh) and you get an idea of my mood on the way to TT's.\n\nUpon arriving, I was immediately rebuffed by the bouncer as apparently it was a 21+ show and I was a mere 18.  (It had never occurred to me that this would be an issue...I'm an idiot)  After 10+ minutes of crying and pleading my case to the bouncer, however, he finally let me in, but only after I swore to him that I wouldn't get people to buy me drinks.  I'm sure he didn't end up checking, but I was dying to see the show so I didn't push my luck.\n  \nThe show turned out to be awesome and I had a rockin good time.  Since it was SL's first time headlining in the US, there was tons of energy in the place and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves thoroughly.  Because of the small size, the energy of the crowd is infectious, which was perfect for this show since everyone was loving it.\n\nI agree with previous reviews that the sound there is substandard.  I do think that the small/intimate size and convenient location somewhat make up for the sound problem though.\n\nOverall, TT's will always remind me of the innocence/idiocy of my freshman year, and I will inevitably be back at some point.", "type": "review", "business_id": "t2xsi7qIN0iwGiOyCn7k8Q"},

Sure it's got that theatrical 1920's flapper/grandma's attic feel...but that's one of the things that makes it so fun.  I love having an excuse to put something sexy on (glamorous sexy, not trashy club sexy) and go for a vintage cocktail and delicious food.\n\nDRINKS-  A lot of posters have complained about the $10-11 vintage cocktails.  PS.  This is a restaurant that carries GOOD liquor, not that no-name crap you find in a plastic bottle. They now carry Absinthe...the real stuff (FYI).  I've never had a bad cocktail here.  Mojitos are amazing, the corpse reviver and ANY of their champagne cocktails are amazing.  They carry a number of fantastic after dinner ports, single malts, cordials...etc.  If you appreciate the quality of a well made drink, please stop by.\n\nFOOD- I've had nothing short of awesome when it comes to their food.  We went last week and ordered 6 or 8 dishes.  They have an amazing scallop ceviche shot that was cold, spicy, citrusy, and the scallop was so creamy and good.  The duck a l'orange crepes and potato croquettes were a delicious standard.  We also had some amazingly tender braised short ribs and a mixed meat tangine with very yummy figgy sauce.  We ordered a side of bread, but really only ate one of the hunks.  it was 2.50 or so, but whatever. we know for next time.  \n\nSERVICE-  We have never had any problems with service.  We've eaten when it has been packed full, we've been during Valentine's Day, as well as when the restaurant was nearly 1/2 empty on a week night.  The ladies that work there are as attentive as we'd like.  They bring our food, ask us if we need drinks when we're nearly done with our current ones, clear our plates when they're empty, and refilled our waters.  \n\nGo here if you are looking for a sexy time with awesome drinks, awesome food, and GREAT people watching.

Oh yeah, I know! This is BY FAR the WORSE dining experience I've EVER had!! With all the poor reviews, I'm surprised they make enough to pay the rent each month. Pay close attention to the bad reviews because they are all VERY accurate. Very poor service and management all around. I'm honestly disappointed because I was really looking forward to trying this place.\n\nThere are so many things that went wrong with our dinner that I hardly know where to begin. First of all, not only did they get our order almost completely wrong, we got something we didn't even order.\n\nInstead of getting the Calamari appetizer that we asked for, we got a Calamari salad, which cost more.\n\nInstead of getting just a burger, I got one with an extra side that I also did not order, which cost more as well.\n\nInstead of getting a MEDIUM steak, my bf got a VERY RARE piece of beef that was lightly seared at most. I should not neglect to mention, however, that they did fix our raw meat problem...they magically turned it into rubber! I didn't know that could be done--amazing!\n\nYou would think that at a place called \"Bubble House\" you could at least get some decent bubble tea. Boy, was I mistaken. Also the worse bubble tea I've every had...& that's saying a lot. Instead of getting the frosted (blended) bubble tea that we anticipated, we got some severely watered-down concoction...and surprisingly enough, the tapioca balls were entirely undercooked. As a matter of fact, the calamari seemed to be the only thing that wasn't undercooked...it was nice and chewy!\n\nDid I mention the chicken wings that we did NOT order and had to pay for anyway?! Ironically, that was probably the best dish we got.\n\nAnd to top it off, they wouldn't allow us to use the Restaurant.com certificate that we had, even though we ordered well more than the $50 min spend (\"Valid for food only. Excludes alcohol.\") specified in the certificate. Who knew bubble tea was not considered food. Oh wait, I forgot, that's right, the bubbles were made from an inedible, gummy substance not qualified to be called food! So after already getting the check, wrapping up my food & giving the waitress my credit card, I was forced to order something else and wait another 20 mins because I was short a WHOLE $2! Of course, they couldn't just apply the cert as a courtesy after all the mistakes that were already made. That was way too much to ask. What WASN'T too much to ask, apparently, was a full 20% tip automatically applied to our check (which was NOT specified in their cert btw, or anywhere else for that matter).  While they did adjust our check for the two earlier mistakes, we still ended up paying a lot more than we had hoped.\n\nNeedless to say, I did not love this place. Take my advice...If you ever find yourself walking over to the Bubble House, just keep on walking...over to the White Dog Cafe next door.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8Wq0LZSuHdPTlleQD5sU_w"},

It was crowded when we got there, so grabbing beers & standing around to wait for a table was a little awkward (all the tables & the bar were occupied), but once we sniped a table (downside: you have to totally hover over a group that is getting up to leave if you want to get it, lest someone grab the table out from under your watch - hence the 100% appropriate term 'snipe'.) If you want to sit down anywhere, be prepared to wait. The place seems to cater more to the folks who want to have a few drinks, which would have been fabulous had we not been waiting to eat, too.\n\nGot a burger along with chicken & veggie kebabs. The burger, unfortunately - while good in its own right - could hold no candle to Tim's. But it was a satisfying \"neighborhood burger,\" flavorful & cooked well.

No need for me to go into detail about that. We had the papadum, garlic naan, and curry chicken: all were fantastic.  \n\nI can't in good conscience give Mint five stars even though I loved the food, had a great time there, and look forward to returning. My reason? Well, the short version is that Mint ran out of \"mint.\"\n\nNo joke. \n\nThe longer version of our experience is below surrounded by lines so you can move on if you don't want to read it. \n=====================================\nMy girlfriend ordered a mojito at the bar. The bartender met us at our table with her \"mojito\" and then apologized for running out of mint. Seriously?! Sir, your establishment is called \"Mint.\" But for the smell of curry or the sign outside that said \"Indian Restaurant,\" I would have assumed that you had Chapel Hill's largest stockpile of mint leaves. Clearly that was a far-fetched assumption. \n\nAs a general rule of thumb, restaurants of this quality (good ones that charge a premium for what they offer in terms of location, food quality, service, and overall experience) ought not run out of anything, especially at the bar, where the bartenders themselves are traditionally responsible for making sure that the restaurant has all of the supplies he/she needs to keep his customers happy. \n\nThis would have ordinarily been an ironic mistake, which the bartender could have remedied by simply saying \"this is really embarassing, but we rant out of mint. Can I offer you another drink instead?\" Rather than doing the obvious, the bartender chose to thread the perilous needle of handing a customer a drink she never ordered. Anyone who knows anything about bartending knows that this is almost always socially inappropriate, and rarely leaves the customer satisfied. \n\nMore specifically, the bartender brought her a \"mojito\" without the mint, and asked if it was \"okay.\" I described this (see above) as socially inappropriate because it puts us on the spot in a most uncomfortable way: (1) it forces us to either refuse the drink, which, in addition to making us feel guilty about a problem we did not cause, requires the bartender to make something else without making more money (he wouldn't rationally expect his tip to go up for doing what we asked for in the first place simply because he is working twice has hard for it), which means we have no reason to believe that he will do the second drink any better, or (2) accept and pay for a drink that we would have never ordered. Making us choose between these options was improper. \n\nThe bartender should have either (1) never offered the not-mojito to her, and should have asked her if she would have liked something else (why would you start mixing a drink that you don't have all of the supplies for anyway), or (2) should have given her the drink, and asked if she wanted something else instead, telling her that he was going to throw it out but figured he should at least give her the option to drink it before he does. In both cases, he should have comp'd the drink, which he didn't. Even if he comp'd the drink, he still failed to ask if he could get her something else in addition to that.

OK, so the bad parts: the setup is HORRIBLE.  i mean, tables in the front for a rock show?  granted he usually plays with a backing band and this time he is touring solo, but he wanted the crowd to stand up and move and get into it, obviously.  but there was no room because people were packed like sardines amongst chairs and tables.  the crowd did their best to work with a bad setup.  it was unnecessarily crowded up front compared to totally empty at the back.  weird.  anyway, rock show  = general admission.  so unhappy about tables in my way of enjoying the concert.  which brings me to my next complaint, i would have reserved one of said tables to get right up front, but i couldn't because i find their food inedible.  i mean, i don't know how you can go wrong with nachos, but they do.  terribly, terribly wrong.  i was smart and ate a small dinner elsewhere first, but even the smells of the food coming from the kitchen was unappetizing to me.  come on, that never happens!   and though it didn't affect me much personally, i thought our bartender was a bit of a dick.  this place needs an entirely new kitchen and bar staff IMO.  i hate being back by the bar, where the speakers don't reach all that well, and hearing more of the bartenders bantering back and forth and glasses clinking than the music itself.  come on, it's not a social lounge, it's a music venue!     \n\ni've been to probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 15 shows downstairs, and 4 upstairs, and i could echo pretty much the same sentiments for the upstairs.  they get two stars for the crystal-clear sound system.  but every time i go there wish to myself that the artist had picked another joint.  favorites on my list: johnny brenda's, and the troc.  honorable mention to TLA, and surprisingly enough, the tweeter center over in camden (preferably in winter, when the curtains are down - good sound system, super-friendly staff).", "type": "review", "business_id": "-5Rah4ZvWsDu4oilUZxhtw"},

The view is amazing and the patio is well decorated with wooden drink rails and and landscaped with tall grasses. For our drinks we started off with a peach Bellini and pomegranate margarita.

I had the pomegranate margarita, and i have never had one made with this type of fruit juice before, and it worked well with the tequila. \nFor food we started with a gorgeous plate of oysters with lemon, seafood sauce and horseradish. The oysters were super fresh, i just wish that they were served with a mignonette. With that we also had the spicy seafood gazpacho with shrimp, squid and scallops. This was one of the most memorable dishes that i had in Atlanta.

It is a small quaint little place that strives to look like a bistro in France. It sort of accomplishes the task.  However, the first thing I noticed upon entering is the wine.  At that point I feared dinner would be abhorrently expensive because the whole place is really one large wine cellar.  They have so much that  almost every table abuts several cases of wine.  This results in a huge intimidating wine list. So large, that I had to ask for help making a choice.  The wine steward (actually stewardess) guided me to an excellent red from the loire valley in the $65 range (this may seem high, but we drink so its usually economical for us to buy a bottle).  We both loved it and have been looking for it at Specs since.\n\nAs for the food, this place met one of my rules for affordable dining:  the menu was on the wall.  From there on, I got over the fear of sticker shock.  Almost all of the handwritten selections looked appealing and the prices were quite reasonable.  I know it is cliche, but we started with the escargot which came out smelling incredible.  The butter and garlic leaped from the dish; very simple but very good.\n\nFor dinner, I settled on the bouillabaisse (about $20) that I would have licked from the bowl if my wife was not there and she loved the mussels (about $20 as well) that she devoured plus we shared a yummy dessert.  All in all, it was well worth the trip and a great bargain at something less than $150 considering the wine, dessert, appetizer and dessert.

The bubbles were severely undercooked. \n\nit's sad that this is the only real bubble tea option in university city. there are so many better places in chinatown.

While I'm not huge into naturopathy or anything, I liked having the option to go in there and pick up some probiotics or lip balm or whatever. I'm not sold on homeopathy or naturopathy, but I thought it was great that there was a store with a staff that seemed invested with which whom I could discuss natural remedies that were potentially a waste of money.\n\nNow I can spend that potential waste of money on a plain t-shirt. I honestly don't get the appeal of American Apparel. I love getting their stuff when other artists have done cool screen printings on them (I like to shop on Etsy) but in general I really rarely need a $20+ T-shirt. Maybe it's a sign that I'm getting older, or maybe it's because I'm not as hip as I think.\n\nTheir sizes piss me off too. I'm a small in some shirts, a medium in others, sometimes a large in tanktops, sometimes not..if this were a department store where one was dealing with different designers it would be one thing, but it all comes from the same place!\n\nAll that said, sometimes you need a nice plain cotton shirt, and they do have them, in an array of colors ranging from neutral to neon. They do one thing, and they do it well and I can't begrudge them that.\n\n I dunno. I grew up in the eighties, I didn't love them then, I don't love them now (and that seems to be their aesthetic) , and their print ads used to sketch me out big time (and before y'all call me prude go check out some of the other places I've reviewed!)", "type": "review", "business_id": "Vs3cchua1FhLbhxN5_W8Yw"},

The avocado & turkey panini I had was heavenly. I was not as impressed with the salad dressings but I will definitely be returning. \n\nAs for the ambiance, I got the feeling this is a restaurant started by a group of late 20 or early 30 somethings. Decor is cute but there was one waitress. While the place is small it's best to have an experienced waitress to handle multiple tables at once. We only saw her twice in the whole restaurant and it seemed every table wanted her attention when she came by. I don't fault her but sometimes it's best to hire a professional rather than a friend or family member (just taking a guess here). \n\nMy only complaint is the hours.

I'll start off by saying that I used to live in Boston and San Francisco, so granted I am a bit spoiled when it comes to training facilities- the gyms I have been a member of in the past were stellar, well equipped, clean and attractive to go to.\n\nBut even given all that, the experience I have had with this gym (now called The Edge) is inexcusable.  First of all, I joined for three main reasons 1) It is close to where I live so I can zip there and back easily. 2) It was a member of the Gold's Gym chain, and since I travel, it would allow me to go to other Gold's locations nationally 3) Although their equipment was not that great, I was PROMISED that they would be getting new cardio and other updates soon.\n\nWell, guess what. Two months later they dropped the franchise. So when I had to travel all last month, I shelled out $60 to go to other gyms. No new cardio equipment, and in fact, half of the cardio they have is broken. I complain daily, and have put in suggestions for specific models and types of machines I want to see. I report that their one stairmill is broken daily. I could go on. When I told the manager how disappointed I was, she basically said tough luck.\n\nNow, I really don't have that many other options (plus I signed a year contract, although it was a contract under the chain when they were still part of the franchise) so I realize that I am not in a place of power. But I do feel lied and misled. I also feel that when I have expressed disappointment at other gyms in the past, they have been more than attentive and accommodating, trying to make their customer feel better about the situation, offering incentives for compensation, etc. I know many other members that feel as I do- dissatisfied. \n\nThat said, the staff there is nice and sympathetic, although they don't seem able to do anything to alleviate the situation.", "type": "review", "business_id": "QuuehfcNexJTr0HL6pnI2A"},

A tour, or at least a little rundown of where everything is, would certainly have added a \"wow\" factor.  \n\nAs for the the hot milk and almond oil, I got a very standard pedicure with massage, and though I enjoyed it, there wasn't anything above and beyond about it. For a $65 service - pedicure only- I was hoping for a mind-blowing pedicure, pampering, and whatever else a Westwood spa would allow me. They did bring me a cup of tea, but it felt like an after thought. \n\nThe polish job lasted a very long time, which was great but mostly because they used OPI nail polish.

While the food isn't comparable to Pasadena or LA, it is better than anything of equal or lesser prices in the area.  \n\nI'd like to clear up a few points people made that were entirely inaccurate:\n\n1.) Walter's does carry chai.  The best chai around for sure.\n2.) When Walter's was a burger joint (about 40 years ago) it was under completely different ownership...don't confuse bad burgers then with the completely different restaurant that shares only a name...\n3.) It is not the intent of the restaurant to be classified as \"Afghan\".  They are a continental restaurant.\n4.) If the bread isn't up to par, ask for better bread.  It's not a problem and the bread comes out of the oven every half an hour.  It's the best bread for miles.\n5.) Walter's has more vegetarian options than most restaurants.  And yes, salads do count.  Even without the salads, you're looking at 5 or 6 vegetarian options which is way more than most restaurants.\n6.) Really?  Did you say good food at the Press and Pizza N Such?  I'd say Walter's is better than both and at Walter's you get ambiance.\n7.) Walter's historically uses a runner/server system.  Who cares who is filling your drink as long as its full.  And know there is a generous tip out system.\n\n\nPeople, prices are based on ambiance and setting and food...you don't sit down at a restaurant only for food..that's what Chipotle is for.  \n\nAnd to clarify, maybe 2 of all the restaurants in Claremont have an actual Chef.

The main problem with the vegetarian fare is that in order to cater to vegans, most of the vegetarian fare is vegan. This is obviously disappointing if you are vegetarian but not vegan. The other bad thing, is that this place has a really, really bad nutritionist on the vegetarian side of things. Seriously -- if you were to exclusively eat from the vegetarian options here, you would be in a lot of trouble, especially if you didn't eat the pizza (which, as far as I can tell, is how they expect you to get all of your vegetarian protein).\n\nSometimes Crossroads as good vegetarian dishes -- especially in the \"Fire & Ice\" Asian section of the dining commons -- but on the whole, the selection is simply far from adequate. Not only is the food inadequate, there simply isn't a lot of variety. There's a dozen or so dishes in the vegetarian area, period. The Mexican food station always has the same options, and the Asian section has two or three vegetarian dishes that are served only occasionally. If you are a vegetarian eating here, you will eat all of the new food you are going to eat here in the first month or so. Towards the end of my second and last year in the dormitories they conducted a survey and focus group due to the overwhelming number of complaints by vegetarians, so things may have changed, but when I ate here a few times during the following fall things seemed the same here.", "type": "review", "business_id": "X2gKwUYR1CQ51XCpKU1_gQ"},

I had only been here once before and it was to have a burger and a beer after a day of intense, pre-Phd examinations. The burger was delicious (it was the first thing I had eaten that day at around 5pm) and the beer (again, on an empty stomach) got the job done.\n\nFast forward to 9-10 months later on a Saturday in February:\nMy friends and I decide we NEED to have calamari and beer. We visit city tap house and they're not serving it until 6pm. It's now 2:30pm. We see that New Deck has calamari on its menu so we decide to go there. We arrive, wait forever to get a table, an additional forever to order, the calamari comes out. There are two tiny plates of small, golden balls of fried batter with a tablespoon of canned (maybe jarred?) tomato sauce on the side. We ask for lemons. The waitress brings 3 slivers of lemon (the kind that sit on the rim of a glass). These slivers are so thin that it is impossible to squeeze the lemon onto the \"calamari\" without first mushing it in between your fingers. We order a few burgers, a salad and the \"char grilled\" chicken quesadilla. The meat in the quesadilla was not grilled, it was soggy, ground, dark meat chicken. The fries that game with the burgers tasted like funk.. sorta like what a wet dishrag would taste like. The salad was somewhere between room temperature and noticeably warm.\n\nNow, if I had visited New Deck at, say, 11:30pm on a Saturday night I wouldn't be surprised that the bathroom was in the state that it was in but 3pm on a Saturday? Piss, toilet paper and what looked like spit was everywhere. They also have these weird faucets that only work if you hold them on.. I was so disgusted and confused. \n\nI'm absolutely positive that I won't be back. I don't care that the quesadilla was $3.00. That's because they used what looked (and tasted) like discarded chicken parts. No thanks.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_PvljXZHQlUmL8SuOXF8ug"},

On one occasion several months ago my husband became very ill after eating an omelette with eggplant.  We've known for years that their  lunch/brunch is not terribly good and have returned several times since then for dinner.\n\nThis past Sunday we went for dinner and it was a nightmare.  First of all, our very sarcastic waitress served our drinks (there were 4 of us) across the length of the table rather than  walking around.  At one point I was sure that should would spill the drink on me.  My husband ordered a la carte from the prix fixe menu and although he asked the waitress what the entree' was like, she reassured him that it was very good, neglecting to tell him that it is smaller than an average appetizer.  The entree' consisted of a small dollop of mashed potatoes, two thinly sliced pieces of salami and two thinly sliced pieces of port tenderloin.  That's it!! Furthermore, the prix fixe dinner is $31 for three courses.  If ordered a la  carte the same 3 courses add up to $33!!  Some deal.  I ordered the lam shank which was 90% bone and very tough.  It came with parmesan polenta which was like gravel.  As we were entertaining others, we did not make a fuss so as not to embarrass them.  This time, we will definitely not return.  EVER.\n\nThe two stars are for the decor and for about half of the wait staff who are actually very professional.", "type": "review", "business_id": "hD55NUiGDK7STQ8oy9QDPA"},

Well I can, but I am still in a pizza coma from tonight. Did the Margherita go up in price from $15 to $17? Still worth it! Tried the San Gennero a couple times now and love it. Sausage is awesome. Tried the Pomodorini too. I am making myself get the Gigiotto Calzoni next. I am going to try and eat that by hand too, no utensils for me. Who eats pizza with a fork? Can you say cram the wad?\n\nI am thinking I should bring them some bacon and see if they will throw some on for me. Mmm. Not like I am anyone to say their pizzas need improvement, because they do not. I just like bacon.\n\nNo loss in quality from the massively increased foot traffic. We still get treated like family.

If your pizza is not cooked in under 55 seconds it will explode. Explode in your mouth that is.\n\nAnd for those of you complaining about lack of tables, they have one now. They always had a couple counters set up by the windows for you to eat at anyway. Is pizza a sit down food now? I like the atmosphere here. You and other patrons are all standing around one big table enjoying and sharing the experience. Much better than just sitting at a little table. There are also plans to extend the eating areas into the parking lot and the parking lot behind the place. It is amazing how much they listen to their customers. They know most people want to eat it right out of the 1000 degree oven. Sitting is for suckers. Ivan and Kit's moms sit on me all the time and believe me, they are suckers.\n\nTime to roll myself home and plop into bed to dream of going back tomorrow.

For some reason, I had the incorrect assumption that Trader Joe's and Whole Foods were the same over-priced place.  Since I despise Whole Foods after a summer spent living in Palo Alto without a car and nowhere else to shop, I never bothered to check out Trader Joe's.  I've found that the prices are actually very reasonable, and although some items do tend to run a little bit more than they do at Safeway, they are nowhere near as overpriced as Whole Foods.   Moreover, they offer a lot of really unique items at reasonable prices that I would have never gotten to try if I stuck to just shopping at Safeway.  For example last night, I picked up their Trader Joe's brand lemon-pepper pappardelle after failing to find pappardelle at Safeway.   At $1.99 for 8 oz, it was about twice the price of Safeway's pasta, but was incredibly delicious and made a lovely meal with just a splash of cream, a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese and a head of broccoli.    I've also found frozen chocolate croissants here that are excellent, and although a bit pricey (about $3.50 for 4) they are still much less than buying a chocolate croissant at a bakery.  They also have sporadic staples that are much cheaper than Safeway - for example, I've seen butter here for $2 as opposed to $4 for the cheapest option at Safeway.  \n\nSo this review ended up being as much for the chain as for this store, but I will say that I have never had a bad experience at this store - it is organized, not too crowded, has friendly staff, and I've always found parking.

Parking, hours, or deposit services have never been an issue for me because I've never stepped foot inside the business - my experience has been online or over the phone. Also, you don't have to be a Trojan or family member to be a customer here. (https://www.usccreditunion.org/usccu/en/about_who_can_join.php)\n\nGetting set up was incredibly easy. After a ten-minute phone call I knew what kind of rate I qualified for and what loan options I had. Their rates easily beat the quotes I got from the dealerships, and I realized it was a waste to let those car guys run my credit at all. Additionally, USCCU offers lunch-n-learn series on topics ranging from home ownership, car buying, investing & retirement to their members. It's a great service that I would utilize if I worked closer. \n\nThe only reason that they have 4-stars is because they, like many other credit unions and community banks, don't quite have the resources to keep up with their multinational conglomerate competitors (Chase, BofA) in terms of online services. Direct debit still needs to be set up via a faxed letter, and other changes (account transfers/payment adjustments) cannot be done online either. But when you need to reach a person, it's pretty easy to do.\n\nOn a separate note, but unrelated to this review: I wish that their home loan services were more expanded because I would have loved to do my home loan with them because their rates are also fantastic. They have a loan officer in a couple times a week, but that is just not enough support for someone going through the home buying process.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_vNydbIbig2OE_QyfL3QqQ"},

I also wanted something convenient to the Providence Waterfire event which was also happening that night.  Honestly, we could have ended after leaving Bacaro and felt the night was great.\n\nTo begin, Bacaro is situated right on the Providence River which actually is very nice at sunset and even better once the torches are lit for Waterfire.  We were able to get a window seat, all the better as our meal overlapped both.  The waiter was incredible- aside from his enthusiasm he was very versed in all of the dishes and wine pairings.\n\nWe started with a wonderful cheese and olive board and pinot grigio that was perfectly chilled.  Mary is a big risotto fan so that was her order, and she was more than satisfied with how it was prepared.  I had the pork chop and mixed vegetables which was equally terrific.  \n\nFor anyone thinking of heading there before Waterfire, try a 5:30 or 6:00 booking to give yourself an hour and half or so.

That was our beginning promotion because we had a lot, and I do mean A LOT, of cases of the plastic Arizona bottles. We pretty much just wanted to get rid of them, so that's why they came with the drinks. It's a nice promotion, but until we get a lot of cases for a really cheap price, I don't know when the next free drink will be.\n\n*Note 3: We've had some people ask about all the deli charges. Basically it comes down to this: If it's a cold sandwich, it's just $4.99, no tax. If you order anything hot, we gotta tax it. The cheese, for 75 cents more, is not taxed. (They've been meaning to get a new deli sign and I keep telling them to make the cheese charge a little more prominent)\n\nPros:\n- A great deli. If you get anything on a roll, it will definitely fill you very quickly. The chicken sandwich is a must. They even sell roasted chicken either by the whole or half and those are delicious too.\n- An eclectic mix of drinks. I love the Looza nectar and the very random soda bottles.\n- It sells produce that gets delivered M-F.\n- It's very convenient for those who don't want to go far to Safeway and don't want to spend tons of money at Whole Foods, Andronico's, or Berkeley Bowl.\n- One banana will not cost you 75 cents on your way to school or work in the morning.\n- They are in the process of fixing the shawarma machine.\n- There is a really cute cashier who works there and is very friendly. If you're short a penny or two, she will let you go. (I think this is where the biased part comes in. *ahem*)\n\nCons:\n- Some of the items sell at retail price, not at a nice discounted price that you can find at the big companies like Walgreens or Safeway. The cereal boxes are at least $4.00 and as high at $6.00.\n- Sandwich prices? Sure, $6.00 for a hot sandwich (not including tax) and the extra 75 cents for cheese may be a lot to some people, but take my word for it: order it on a roll (since the bread fills you up quickly) and you will see how much you can eat of that whole sandwich.\n- No seating. For now anyway.\n\nWe're getting good business; people like our deli and they like our convenient location. We may be getting the liquor license at some point and I hear from those who shop at Fred's on University, they stock really fun and an eccentric mix of alcohol.\n\nP.S. They are going to keep the Rexall sign as a part of history. The place that was there before Sam's actually wasn't even Rexall; it was called Blue Heaven. At and some point before that, there was a soda pop diner called Foley's... thus the name of the deli.", "type": "review", "business_id": "AGHq9c6BgxBWwnasdCYPQQ"},

The most recent time I was at Brochstein Pavilion was for the Zadie Smith reading, which almost inspired another crisis, as I contemplated becoming a writer. Never mind that the last time I wrote any non-Yelp-related items was for a writing class I took in New York, which taught me that I'm not in touch with my emotions enough to be a writer (write about past experiences under the guise of fiction? erk). \n\nPeople kept telling me about how the campus has changed, pointing to the Brochstein Pavilion. It's most often spoken of in a positive light. I can understand it. It's an all-glass building, with tables outside on the perimeter. The tables inside include normal-dining-height levels, though the chairs are of the sort you might see at an outdoor wedding (horizontal strips of wood for the backing), as well as those at knee-level with blue-winged chairs, which call to mind a Jetsons-era airport lounge. The food is from Salento, which closes earlier than the Pavilion, with paninis, empanadas, coffee, and the like. Again, the setup of the Salento as a circular free-standing white (as with the rest of the interior)...thing is futuristic airport-esque, though we're probably not calling them airports in the future--hoverports, anyone?\n\nThe positives are also what makes Brochstein Pavilion three stars. Technically, it's in the middle of campus, if you consider the Greenbriar lot/guest parking ($1/day) at one end and the North colleges at the other end. It'd really be more central if it was stuck on top of the statue of Willie, which I imagine would be super futuresque--a rotating glass building on top of a statue. And, I need to reiterate this: Brochstein Pavilion is a GLASS BUILDING. Rice students are not hothouse flowers. They don't flourish in the sun. How are they supposed to maintain a ghostly pallor if they study in a glass building? Not that the hoverport chairs and wedding tables are conducive to studying. And, if students are exposed to the sun, they can't lose track of the passage of time. \"Oh, look, the sun's gone down. Time to head home.\" Study FAIL. Literally. \n\nOkay, so maybe a building that promotes discussion and socialization isn't all that bad, but I still take umbrage with how at odds it is with most of campus. Damn you, change!

We ended up at City Tap House. This huge new space is beautiful, if weird. Located in the heart of University City, it has the potential to attract an annoying crowd. But we didn't deal with any of that on our visit. The staff here is great, and our bartender was knowledgeable about his beer. He was willing to pour samples and offered carefully thought suggestions.\n\nThe space is beautiful. The bar is probably the largest in the city, and City Tap house also boasts a sizable dining room with an open kitchen. To top it off, there's an great outdoor area complete with faux fire pits. Overall, the space is impressive and well used. even the bathrooms leave a good impression. \n\nLet's move on to the important part: Beer. The first time I visited City Tap House I was part of a record setting night: Most taps by a brewery in a single place at once. Ever. The brewery was Bell's and there were some great beers available. Still, on a normal day, the Tap House boast a quite respectable list. With the sixty taps available, they offer something for everyone and are simultaneously able to have more than a few rare and impressive drinks on tap. I had a black IPA, Hop in the Dark, from Deschutes Brewery, and, at the moment, City Tap House is the only place in the state that has beer from Deschutes. I cannot imagine the person (other than those who do not like beer at all) that is unable to find something enjoyable.\n\nThe menu here is impressive. While ordering, I was wrestling between several different choices, and there is a dinner menu available that I didn't even see. Because I believe the cheeseburger is the standard to which all other food at an establishment can be benchmarked, I ordered one medium rare with mushrooms and bleu. It came out quickly and well cooked. It was a huge burger, and in reality, I should have only ate half of it. Everything on the burger was high quality, with the bleu cheese as an incredible standout. While not my favorite burger I've ever had, I have no hesitation putting this on the highest echelon of burgers in the city. The thin, crispy fries perfectly round out the dish.\n\nDan ordered a pizza, and it came out perfectly cooked. The pizza is cooked in a brick oven, and the result is a crispy, thin pizza that, like the burger, is excellently crafted. Also like the burger, one pizza is more than enough food for one person. City Tap House offers several mouth watering combinations of toppings for the pies.\n\nBottom Line: Prices are on par with everything else in this area. The space is beautiful and huge, just like the tap list. The food rounds out this contender for the best bar in West Philadelphia.", "type": "review", "business_id": "LwX2vbzttWYAdoBoVtfvRg"},

Dehydrated and expecting a long workday (today), I chose against imbibing, deciding instead to gorge myself on nachos Garcia, broccoli and mushroom pizza, a cubano sandwich, molten lava cake, and pale ale bread pudding (the bf ate exactly 2/3 of all this).  The place was pretty empty and pretty, well, boring.  It was rather devoid of character or anything resembling charm.\n\nThe nachos were supposed to have veggie chili on them.  I saw maybe 1.5 teaspoons of that; it was mostly sour cream.  The pizza was mediocre, with approx. 1 tablespoon of toppings for an entire $12 pizza.  I ordered this arugula asparagus salad with it for like $9 that was wilted and had exactly 2 measly asparagus spears.  The cubano was pretty good.  I love pretty much any bread pudding, but this pale ale bread pudding was drenched in this savory rather disgusting sauce which killed it for me.  Nothing was presented with any sort of pride.\n\nThe service was distracted, but very sweet.

Okay here goes:\n\nFor the chicken, the difference between medium spicy and spicy-spicy is really big. Medium spicy doesn't even taste spicy, while spicy is really spicy (which I prefer). I don't order the chicken too much though since I don't crave it as much and can't finish it by myself unless I'm reallllly hungry.\n\nFor the drinks - pretty standard, however the drinks a sweeter than the Convoy version, which can sometimes take away from the tea flavor in milk teas. I mistook this location's ownership as the same as the convoy one, but it's not. It's owned by the people who own the regents location. Anyhow, the drinks are still pretty good. I definitely would recommend the taro milk tea and almond milk tea if you really want something sweet.\n\nService: IDK what it is, but I feel like this place is ONLY efficient if males are working. For some reason whenever there's only girls working, the service is pretty slow. I went here yesterday on my break and it was pretty backed up in terms of drinks, so I was actually LATE back to work! The girl who was working was pretty slow. I watched her and I couldn't believe it! Even when the was backed up before, when there were guys working -- even just a single guy -- the service was pretty quick. When it's mixed guys and girls, it moves pretty fast too.\n\nThe owner (I'm assuming it's the slightly older lady that I see there from time to time and was there on the first day it opened) is really sweet. She really cares about her customers, and that's really important. Whenever the wait is long, she apologizes, and she even makes the drinks really fast too! I swear she makes the drinks faster than probably the two girls working one time while a guy rang up the orders.

Over the years I've been such a loyal Sao Paulo's patron that, really, I may as well put a ring on it.\n\nSeriously every meal I've had here is pretty damn delicious. So much so that once a waiter was actually visibly taken aback by how quickly a girlfriend and I had \"demolished\" (his word, not ours) two gigantic dishes. Here are my reviews for some oft-demolished favorites:\n\nPollo Magdalena - easily my favorite dinner here - the red tortilla-encrusted rolls of chicken breast stuffed with crabmeat, spinach, and cream cheese are mildly crispy on the outside and succulent, saucy, and meaty on the inside. They rest on a sufficiently generous bed of rice and veggies, and the mild ancho sauce adds some needed moisture to the mix. \n\nBobo de Camarao -  this is the Austin Chronicle award-winning dish, and deservedly so! A really nice amount of shrimp and yucca served in a GREAT tomato and coconut cream sauce + bell peppers/onions + rice. I'm usually sort of skittish about yucca since I think it can so often be rendered bland, but the nutty and creamy blend of flavors balances well with it in this case.\n\nEnchiladas de Chipotle - finger-licking good satisfaction! I mean, I know that with the monterey jack cheese and mild chipotle sauce this pretty much meets your usual enchilada standards + the typical rice and beans fare. But Sao Paulo's really does it well - hot, delicious cheesiness!\n\nGalinhada (Brazilian paella) - meat + jasmine rice suffused with a tasty amount of herbs and veggies - saffron, cilantro, tomatoes, and onions. Definitely hits the spot when you're hunting for some non-Spanish, but equally satisfying paella.\n\nOutside of the food, the atmosphere's great, too. Kooky modern art with romantic undertones adorns the walls, the lighting's dim, and the candles make it a very cute datey scene. The live Latin bands are pretty fab as well and really set the mood for the South American cuisine. But a tip - sit in the back if you're hoping for a conversation since it's quite loud up front. Parking can be a bit obnoxious on a busy night, so if you're near/on campus I might recommend walking it.\n\nGo! Soon! Tonight!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "4_Z2QGkLj5QICAaSv94gnQ"},

Rolls used to be larger and not so hurriedly constructed.  And the pork katsudon bowl was very small for $10.  You get almost 25% more at Yakitori Boys--same price, and a lot tastier.\n\n4.  Everyone complains about the service of the one waitress.  I think she is the owner or part owner.

Annoying as that is, however, the Sassy Chai latte is the real deal.  Spicy, not overly sweet (even with soy milk!), and made with real looseleaf tea as opposed to Oregon Chai.  And, a small is only $2.99!!!  Be still my heart.\n\nService is fast and friendly, and it's a little oasis tucked behind Doheny library, which just happens to be my favorite building on campus.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bLSQiJx_M9vZwO7TLBrBIA"},

When we arrived on that Friday, the manager told us that all of the rooms were already sold out and that he only had us down for reservations on Saturday night.  He then proceeded to call us liars and told us that we didn't have any proof that we had reserved both nights (the confirmation number they had given over the phone apparently didn't serve as proof).  I stay in hotels fairly often and have seen this situation before in small-town hotels ... the hotel promises a really good deal because they think the hotel will be empty and then it turns out to be a popular night and they rent your room for a higher rate.\n\nAnyways, I sort of understand that situation and would not have even been all that upset if the manager would've politely said something like  \"let me phone a hotel down the street and see if we can get you a room, and we'll knock a few bucks off of tomorrow night's rate here with us.\"\n\nBut instead, the manager just stood there looking at us meanly with his arms crossed.  Eventually, I broke the silence by saying \"well, can we do something to make this right?  As of right now, this is the worst customer service I've ever had at a hotel.\"  He then got really mean and repeated that we didn't have proof that we had reserved both nights, and that he was going to do nothing.  It got a little heated after that, and when I asked him to cancel my reservation for Saturday night.  He told me that it was too late to cancel that reservation.  After some heated words and a threat to call the Ramada corporate office (which I will make good on), he eventually told me that he was going to do me a \"favor\" and cancel my Saturday night reservation.\n\nWe ended up staying at the Le Quesenta up the street, which was very nice.\n\nI can't say anything about the hotel itself, as I did not actually stay there.  However, I want to warn people that you cannot rely on reservations at this hotel to ensure that you have a place to stay when you get to SLO. They will rent to the highest bidder (they seemed really greedy). If you do make reservations, be sure they e-mail you the reservation, or you may get hosed with only your confirmation number.\n\nIf I could, I would givw this place zero stars.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6JrdX_-KWvPSzXA9oDrtnw"},

Any type of crowd.\n\nPeople mill around everywhere and bump into you while you are seated at the bar. If you sit at the back of the bar farthest away from the entrance and towards the back you are in what one bartender called \"The Dead Zone\". She used this as an excuse to cover up the fact that she screwed up, forgetting about my beer order for at least 10 minutes after I placed it with her. Mind you this was the 2nd screw up, the first being that she never placed our order for a pizza, which we only discovered after waiting an hour. That's why you got a small tip. Own up to your mistakes instead of bullshitting me.\n\nIf you sit in the non Dead Zone you might have to still grab a bartender by the chest or use a flare gun in order to get a 2nd beer, even if your pint glass was long empty and you had politely indicated that you needed service.\n\nThe food is less than stellar in the bad City Tap House. My Cubano had the worst pulled pork I've ever had on it.  How does someone consciously serve dried ass pork that literally crunched when I bit into it? The chicken press sandwich I had was a hot mushy mess that had no discernable flavor. Someone isn't checking the dishes before they leave the kitchen, or their standards are abysmally low. \n\nThis place has the potential to kick every other bar's ass in the area.

To echo some of the other Yelpers' sentiments, this is a really cozy, quaint  hotel. The hotel is also steps away from the Kendall T stop on the red line and it's easy to get to/from the airport from this stop.\n\nOther than that, I didn't find anything at the Kendall Hotel to be extraordinary. A few Yelpers praised it for the customer service, but it didn't seem exceptional to me. In fact, when I first go there and was checking in at the front desk (around 9 pm when it was hardly busy), the front desk clerk answered the phone just as I had stepped up to the counter and proceeded to chat it up with someone (who I'm guessing also worked there ) to tell him/her about her not-so-busy day. I stood there waiting for at least 5 minutes listening to a clearly non-important conversation. \n\nThe hotel also doesn't offer room service (and the kitchen at their in-house restaurant closes at 9:45 pm). I don't usually order room service, but I got in late and hadn't had dinner yet and it was on my company's tab anyway. There's a Legal Seafoods bar/restaurant across the street, which seemed to be the only dining option, at that time of night, within walking distance.\n\nI had to catch a cab to the office one morning and unfortunately they don't have a taxi stand outside. You either have to ask the front desk to call a cab for you, or walk around the block to the Marriott's taxi stand.", "type": "review", "business_id": "0ttf8ZaXC_67Tv1Gx47WBQ"},

Well, since it's relatively warm or hot most days in Berkeley, I don't have a problem with that.

I'm pretty sure all the frozen yogurt places get their mochi from the same vendor because one time Papamingo and Yogurtland both had rainbow mochi instead of white mochi.  Sometimes if you're lucky, there will be green apple or melon flavored mochi!  It was there two weeks ago I think.  \n\nGOOD: Self serve, 25 cents/oz on Monday, super nice Korean owner, four different cup sizes to choose from\nBAD: Only six flavors to choose from, and it's been like that for almost 4 months.\n\nIt's a shame that Papamingo isn't frequented more by Cal students.

My favorites were the \"perfect cheese\", Gruyere that night with raspberries, pistachios and apple slices (that were on the mushy side) and the chicken liver ravioli.\nI didn't like the options on their menu, however.  It seemed like there was always one ingredient too much pushing me to a point where I dismissed an entire dish simply b/c one ingredient made it sound less palatable.\nAlso, they only have one chicken dish, one beef dish, one pork dish, one veggie dish.  I could have had more options in that area, which is why I went with an appetizer instead.\nLots of cool kitschy things make this place look pretty hip: the menu is attached to a clipboard with rubber bands; the chairs are plastic; very open room contrasts the low ceilings and makes it seem like a bigger space.\nService was very friendly.\nEverything was pleasant, although I was not impressed enough to make it a place I automatically think of whenever I wanna throw down some dough in Kendall Square.", "type": "review", "business_id": "RThn3_Y6qN8MsqZKWa6WyQ"},

Granted it is a tad expensive for the ingredients that go into a lomo saltado, i was still CRAVING it. I also ordered an extra serving of Aji, the peruvian green-colored sauce.  Even with both servings of Aji, it was far from enough for me.  But regardless! The beef was slightly overcooked, but the dish definitely did satisfy my craving for what I wanted. They also did not provide enough rice for my liking, so I simply heated and added a bit of leftover rice I had in my fridge.  On the positive side, I was happy with the portions; it definitely filled me up for the rest of the night!\n\nNext time, I'm going to try to go to the restaurants itself to see if they offer unlimited Aji through a squeeze bottle or something.

Clearly, my level of trust on the food here was in their hands now...\n\ni decided to go with the mussels when a couple adjacent to the corner of us, had their monstrosity of a burger come out.... the husband saw my dimly light eyes bright up... and said \"she's been thinking about this burger all day...since 2pm\".  better than sex i thought?  i so desperately wanted to find out. i quickly chased down the bartender who kindly enough was able to change my order just in the nick of time. \n\nLocal Grass-Fed Burger - stuffed with cheese, house made sesame bun, mace ketchup, home made celery root slaw and pickles and the thinnest shoe string fries ever made on earth.  tasted straight like potato stix from the can, plus the chives, garlic and cayenne pepper that it was topped with.  amazing crack substance, i mean...additive.  it was the perfect complement to the over-sized juiced burger.  safely medium please.  i put my money on eating \"half\" the burger before giving up.  the fries, the burger... gracious gluttony.  i'd be a complete fatty (and quite the feat) if i were able to finish it.  gluttony knows boundaries too...and i still had a \"night\" to get through.  the comatose would just have to wait a few more hours.   \n\nladies and gentleman, i have to say for the first time in about 10 years, i forgo seafood for RED MEAT...and it felt wonderful.  my friend highly enjoyed her sturgeon... she offered, but i happily declined.  i was much content stuffing my face with the burger & fries instead.  that's what she said!\n\nit's important to note that this place is not your typical, traditional french fare.  rather modern american, nuances of french infused.  this place is brilliant- for upscale foodies, saavy'nites, masochists, modernists... forgo the well mannered, prim & proper tables and get your ass to the bar and enjoy the food there...(unless you obviously want to try the tasting menu...which i definitely do for next time...)  it's one hell of an experience wherever you end up.  or be smart and call to make reservations ahead of time.  that's what she said...", "type": "review", "business_id": "58cDJU4cub1o0o0B4h9GrA"},

It takes forever, it is funny in a Marx brothers kind of way, but it can also be extremely annoying.

I could only come up with the answer of   \"I don't\" \n\nWhy would anyone think of all two blocks of this hidden bourgeois wonderland made up of a several colleges with fancy old libraries? And it's probably for a good reason. I mean, it's technically in the 909, right? \n\nMore puzzling is that it sits between Pomona and Rancho. Like a little gem surrounded by.. well, the rest of the I.E. But maybe that's a good thing. Maybe that's why when I drive into the area I feel like I was just transported to some place different... almost welcoming.. \n\nA small tucked away town with one gas station that could easily be mistaken for a Santa Barbara style city. Best of all is that next to the local art house, which prominently proclaims that none of its theaters are in 3D you have the Back Abbey. \n\nThe Back Abbey is a place I heard about a while back and sort of just forgot. Again it's Claremont. But thanks to Matthew P. I decided that I was finally going to try them out and boy am I glad that I braved stepping foot into the 909 for it. \n\nI have to say, it's really a nice little area and I just feel bad that it's stuck at the gates of the I.E. Talk about bad luck. The city must have been in the bathroom when god was passing out town positions. But in an effort to make it up to this wonderfully quaint little village, he bestowed upon them a burger establishment that is worthy of saying \"God Damn!\" \n\nI mean, seriously, God damn, that is one tasty burger! \n\nIt's almost as if you took Father's office and instead of being your literal father, you made it some spiritual one (hence the monk made brew and monastery appearance) Because this burger is heavenly with every bite you'll think you're getting closer to god. \n\nIn theory I guess you are, considering the amount of calories one could expect to be had from such decadence. But yeah, this burger was a clear sign that yes, there is a higher being up above and yes, he loves hamburgers. \n\nAll this coming from an atheist, so you know that's saying something. \n\nBut yeah, the place has a very missionary look to it. I guess it doesn't hurt that it has a vast amount of Belgian beers for the offering. I mean, it's really a great beer selection. And even though I favor local craft beers a bit more, mainly because I can actually pronounce the beer's names, I have to say I don't have any problem making a fool out of myself in saying the beers here. \n\nNow I was eating alone and to some of you, eating alone, let alone drinking alone would be a sign of just being sad. No sir. How can anyone be sad with a good beer and a lot more fries that you need not share? \n\nI got myself a half order of fritas and even that seemed like way too many. Though I felt compelled to finish them all. How could you leave fries that have been double fried. Once in duck fat and once in soybean oil? It would truly be a sin and I already spent far too much time confessing for my sins eating that burger. No way do I want to confess anymore. \n\nYour gut instinct may be telling you to fight tooth and nail for a seat inside. I mean, it is cold (Well.. for SoCal, I guess), but I have to say that the outside patio seats were so much better than eating inside. A lot more chill. It also helped that they had heat lamps going so you really weren't feeling any of the cold anyway. \n\nAnd if you were, well there's always more beer to warm you up. And again, there's a lot of it. I mean, the main problem I have with Belgian beers is I always feel like a fool ordering the first two or three beers. Then after that I just blame the inability of pronouncing the name correctly on already tossing back a few. \n\nIf there's one reason to go to Claremont it's for this burger.. and I guess to see how the 909 isn't all a complete wasteland you'd expect to see in some Mad Max movie. \n\nI mean, there's not even a single meth lab or RV in any part of town!

Seriously, they have so many things to choose from, and after you've chosen a sandwich, you can customize it any way you want. But because there are just so many to choose from, I feel like some of their sandwiches are really good while others are just ok. \n\nMy friend loved her Kevorkian (hot pastrami, bacon, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, hot sauce) while I thought my Dead Head (sprouts, carrots, cold provolone, tomato, onion, oil & vinegar) wrap was ehh. I feel like at Geoff's, you should get a hot sandwich; they have these cool steamer things that they use to heat the meat and melt the cheese to utter perfection. So next time I'm back in Rhode Island, I'll definitely be getting a hot vegetarian sandwich.\n \nI was also a little confused when I got my Dead Head wrap because it was different than what was on the menu. There weren't any carrots; instead, they were replaced by raw mushrooms. I also asked for a whole wheat wrap, but it came out in a green spinach wrap. And I don't think that the greens in my wrap was spinach; it tasted like romaine lettuce to me. So there might have been some misunderstanding when I placed my order, but these guys get crazy busy and they make all these sandwiches from memory, so I can't really blame them for mixing up a few ingredients. \n\nHowever, one of the best things about Geoff's is the people who work there; they're so cool! The guys making the sandwich always joke around with their customers, making the atmosphere very chill and casual and I immediately felt welcome there (even with a giant DSLR around my neck). The workers here are more than willing to recommend a sandwich for you, as well as tell you what's good that day.\n\nThis place definitely has a lot of character, and a must-visit if you're ever in Providence. i know I'll definitely be back next time I'm in the area, just to try another one of their sandwiches and say hi to the workers :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "t2tHuFNhPhlknnML7kzLww"},

We were given one of the worst rooms in what resembled \"the welfare wing\" of the hotel.  \n\nTop 5 things that were so NOT right with our room and / or the overall hotel atmosphere / appearance:\n\n1) Parking lot was too small for the size of the hotel:  almost every night when we got back from our day trips, the parking lot was jam packed and there were no spots available.  Instead of offering complimentary parking at the public garage directly across the street, the staff at the front desk pretty much just shrugged their shoulders and told us we were on our own to find parking (except for on the weekend, when parking in the garage across the way was free).  REALLY?  That's how you show your preferred club members appreciation for being loyal?\n\n2) No refrigerator in our room (this is the only hotel I've ever stayed at where the room didn't have at least some sort of mini fridge)\n\n3) Plumbing issues:  our sink kept backing up from the first time we used it and the faucet was installed incorrectly (you had to turn the handle to the \"hot\" side to get cold water and vice versa).\n\n4) Overall cleanliness:  Rugs and floors throughout the building's public areas were dirty.  The rugs looked like they hadn't been properly vacuumed in weeks and there were a lot of cobwebs in the corners of the hallways and stairs.  The rug in our room was only vacuumed ONCE the entire week we stayed there.  There were cobwebs inside all of the lampshades in our room. Gross.\n\n5) Overall, the amenities were severely lacking.  No complimentary continental breakfast for preferred members, ice / vending machines not conveniently located (especially considering that there was no mini fridge provided in the room), pillows and comforter were stained.\n\nAnother thing that bothered me about this place was the way they treat their staff.  The staff had an outdoor eating table / break area that consisted of a picnic table tucked away behind a high fence...DIRECTLY next to the garbage dumpster!  REALLY?!  That's how you treat your staff that works hard all day to keep this hotel afloat?  No wonder they can't be bothered doing a thorough cleaning job around the hotel if they are being treated that way!\n\nNeedless to say, we won't be staying here on our next visit to Ithica.  We'll be staying at the Hilton across the street or at a B&B and get better service for pretty much the same price!", "type": "review", "business_id": "iQJ54YzzImrYF-4WXhS6gA"},

For me, this El Mercado has a convenient location.  It's only a 2 block walk from my office.  So, since I failed to pack a lunch today, I decided to try this place out.  \n\nI found the decor and atmosphere pleasant--lots of bright colors on the walls.  The center of the dining area featured a nice skylight and a fountain (no water in it).  The tables and booths were far enough apart that I didn't feel cramped.\n\nService was polite, and we got what we ordered, but the timing was a little off.  We got chips, but salsa didn't come for another 2 or 3 minutes.  Water refills were lagging.  It took a long time to get the check; then the server took a long time to come back and run our credit card, too.  They advertised \"Express Lunch\" and I didn't think they lived up to that at all.\n\nThe food wasn't bad though.  It wasn't particularly good, but with fajita chicken tacos for $5.75 (lunch menu) I thought I got my money's worth.    The lunch special, a carne asada burrito ($6.50), was sort of nasty though.  The sauce sort of tasted like gravy to me, and the meat was a weird texture.  I guess I was expecting the meat to be something like Chipotle's barbacoa, but it wasn't.  \n\nIt looked like they had some good happy hour deals, so I might check that out some time, but I probably wouldn't make and effort to go here for food again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "jylGZBet5C2CwJ-X0odhsg"},

I also love New Seattle Massage, the co-op in the University District where Dennis practices. The facilities are spotless, fresh clean towels always available for use and for a small extra fee you can use the steam room and sauna. \n\nMy first visit with Dennis was a last minute call looking for coinciding appointments for my partner and I. Normally I wouldn't chose to see a male practitioner but I have to say I am very happy that I opened my mind and pushed my own boundaries to give Dennis a chance.\n\nDennis is a soft spoken man who very quietly and gently asks you about why you are there and what you are looking for. Actually his demeanor is so gentle that when I laid on his table I was quite shocked but the significance of his touch. Dennis has strong hands but is keenly aware of my reactions to his touch and always seems to adjust his pressure intuitively. \n\nDennis has a routine. My massages are almost always the same with him but they are different than with any other massage therapist I have ever seen. Dennis uses the usual techniques but he also has some unusal moves that one might prefer to be prepared for. This is not a lay down and go to sleep for an hour kind of massage. Dennis requries some passive participation. The first time he asked me to grip his hand and pulled me to the top of the table leaving my head and arms hanging I was a little leery but as I hung there for a moment I felt the stretch relieving tension in places I never expected to be relieved. \n\nThe biggest difference between Dennis and other LMP's I have worked with is that he is there to relieve your aching body not just through rubbing but stretching also. He has a way of making me feel relaxed and comfortable, to trust him when it is against my instinct. \n\nI have just made another appointment to see Dennis tommorow. I think this will be my 5th or 6th visit with him and I am so looking forward to it!", "type": "review", "business_id": "nzUdsdaLIT2LC-cUyVjxWQ"},

Correction: Golden Wok has the best pad thai EVER.  And yes, this is comparing it against not only the local places, but also every thai restaurant I've ever been to, and I've been to plenty.  The reason why their pad thai is so good is because of the flavoring: A lot of other Thai places either don't have enough of it, or they have so much that it's overly sweet and/or salty and it becomes so cloying I can't ever bear to finish it.  Golden Wok's pad thai, on the other hand, is done so well I finished it very quickly in one sitting...and as others have said, their portions are VERY generous.  Besides the flavor, the noodles are also done well, not mushy and stuck together, and not undercooked, and overall the dish isn't too oily either.  Four stars for the delicious pad thai all on its own; I haven't tried anything else there but we'll see how that goes...like I said, I usually stay away from \"chinese/thai\" places, but I feel like Golden Wok has earned my respect, if nothing else for their pad thai.\nThey have their own lot, so parking isn't as bad as it is on campus.

The place was easy enough to get to on a Tuesday night, and parking was easy. As we walked to the restaurant, their neighbor had some folks standing on the sidewalk giving out samples of what appeared to be some sort of Slush Puppy, but neither of us tried it; we decided that would be our dessert.\n\nWe were seated quickly, but when our server showed up barely a minute later with water, he didn't offer to take our drink orders, but wanted to know if we were ready to order. Huh? We'd barely had time to figure out what we wanted to drink. We told him we weren't ready to order our entrees yet, and he said ok and walked off. Hmmm... restaurants usually push the $10 drinks and $5 beers, and I even made the comment \"no drinks for us, I suppose.\"\n\nOur server did come back a few minutes later and took our drink, appetizer and entr\u00e9e orders. Our spring rolls and chicken satay came out first. While the spring rolls were very light and airy, they lacked taste in addition to weight. Had they had any flavor at all, they would have been the best spring rolls I've ever had. The chicken satay was good, but not noteworthy.\n\nFor our entrees, I went with the Cashew Nut Stir-Fry, and my buddy went with the Golden Red Snapper. My stir fry was ok, but nothing to write home about. It didn't really taste like there was very much seasoning on it, but it was satisfying with its small bowl of jasmine rice. My buddy's snapper came out on a sizzling griddle like fajitas at a Mexican restaurant. I didn't taste it, but there wasn't anything left on his plate when he was done. Perhaps there's a reason the menu refers to it as \"our house favorite\".\n\nAll in all, the food wasn't spectacular, but it wasn't bad either... just mediocre. I won't make a special trip to Spoon, but if I'm in the area I'd go back.

It's boring, and there's all these strangers around sweating and grunting.  It's nasty, it hurts, it's expensive, and I don't want to do it.  But I finally got to thinking this year, it's time to commit to this.  I did the free week membership at one of those large basement gyms where there's, like, 236 people in a row on all these machines and a used band-aid on the bathroom floor.  No thanks.  I need somewhere quiet and clean.  Something small scale where no one has to witness my paltry feats of strength.\n\nVim Fitness is new, small, and somewhat undiscovered.  It's tastefully furnished with all new equipment, located above the Karma Yoga Studio with a view of Mass Ave below, and the founder/personal trainer, Pierre, is a nice guy.  Fortunately, my company made a discount deal, because otherwise I'd never be able to afford this place, so be warned.  Being so new, it has its share of growing pains (I joined in June and was just given a membership card today), but it's relatively uncrowded.  Usually it's just me and a few others.  Sometimes I'm completely alone.\n\nThere are about 3 treadmills, 5 ellipticals, 2 bikes, 3 spinning bikes, and ample free weights and machines.  Because the space is so limited, there is the potential for feeling like you're in someone's way when they're having their personal training session (tonight I almost got hit by a dropped medicine ball).   The thing is, so far, even on the busiest day, there was never a problem adjusting my schedule to work around people so I could use the machine or flat bench I wanted, which is exactly what a whiney fitness-hating prole like myself needs.", "type": "review", "business_id": "AEkLw1YKRsoOpHaHclVXiA"},

Others may have a preference for certain ways in which Japanese food has been Americanized, but if you're interested in Japanese food that tastes the way it does in Japan, this is a great little place.\n\nFor example, I'm often startled (yes, startled) to be served tempura that has been sitting around for a few minutes.  Like radioactive elements, hot food (especially things like tempura) have a half-life, only instead of losing half of its radioactive particles, hot food loses half of its deliciousness.  In the case of tempura, it's very hard for any food to be better than just-cooked tempura.  After about five minutes, you'd take it over eggplant.  After ten minutes, you'd eat it rather than starve.  Probably.\n\nAt Matsuri, the tempura is served immediately, which of course is how it's done in Japan.  My years in Japan made me a bit of a fanatic for hot food, western convention of serving all food at once be damned.\n\nThe sushi is also good, although any place that uses fresh fish, actual sushi chefs, japanese rice and the right kind of vinegar in the rice should produce sushi that is good enough for the great majority of flavor dullards, including me.  When you taste that the fish has been frozen or when the rice is al dente, you know you've made a wrong turn at Albuquerque, but that's definitely not the case at Matsuri.", "type": "review", "business_id": "RiZqeuLN-3y04yh4c20Y0A"},
