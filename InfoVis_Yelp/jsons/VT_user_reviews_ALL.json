Also, they seemed to have interesting drinks such as mulled cider and sipping chocolate, so perhaps I would go back in the winter to try those.

Thanks to a business trip to AL (don't ask), I purposely declined the paid airfare and drove so I could intentially eat here a few weeks ago.\n\nSERVICE:\nI still love this place.  Not only was the service great - yes they are more laidback than most Asian servers in Asian restaurants who stare at you while you eat and immediately fill up your empty (or half empty glass) before putting it down, BUT.. this is a college town with college students mostly being the customers.  I would expect a more laid-back atmosphere here.. i mean, college dining options are usually small, quirky affordable places to eat with out the white table cloths, no?\n\nOur server from last year remembered us...down to what we ordered, where we were from and the stories we told. =)  I mean, that is pretty good service.   He wasn't working that day - just checking in, i guess, but he came over and suggested a few dishes and said hello =)  Our real server was just a polite and prompt.  \n\nThe FOOD:\nHere is the big reason we come back here.  The FOOD!  I mean, I love authentic Thai (and this might not be the MOST authentic)... but it has amazing, amazing flavor.  \n\nDrunken Noodle\nI always get the Druken Noodle (this is my favorite, I can't help it). It was very good, but I have to admit it wasn't as good as last year's version.  The herbs and spices mixed throughout was a nice touch.  I loved that the noodles here are never undercooked and always delicious.\n\nChicken Soy Noodle Soup (something like that)\nIt was a special that was suggested to us by our previous server.  He said the soup was made from scratch everyday and the chicken was fall-off-the-bone.  The soup had a nice salty-sour flavor reminiscent of one of my faves, Tom Yum Soup.. but with an added touch of soy.  The chicken wasn't as fall-off-the-bone as i expected, but we were SO early to the restaurant it had just opened a minute before... I think if it had a half hour more, it would have been perfect.  This was delicious nonetheless. (NOTE - cleanse palate before going from drunken noodles to this dish.. they don;t mix well).\n\n\nWe didnt try too many of the dishes that other yelpers have complained about.. but I can't imagine that the pad thai woudl be that bad based on our experiences.\n\nPrices - they are a bit pricer than the local fare, but we lov ethe flavor so.. we were fine with it.\n\nWe have always come here in late July/August when the campus is not as full as it is during the fall and spring.. so maybe this is basis for the difference in service and food reviews.\n\nI willl have to come back and try this place again when classes are in session - but for now..

I know their reputation for ripping people off is well-known, but I didn't think getting my car inspected would cause such a headache. The initial wait was about 2 hours on a monday morning around 10am. Main entrance is clean, and seating area has a TV which is nice. After my car had been inspected, around 1215pm, the customer service rep came & sat down next to me in the waiting room. Oh boy, i thought. Whats wrong? She informed me that a few things were not up to par with my vehicle, and i was inclined to listen in order to pass inspection. I needed new tires - ok, I thought...that sounds like it could be possible. She then informed me that I had \"no oil\" in my car. Well thats not possible, because I just got my oil changed about 2 weeks prior. Is she really trying to hustle me? I told her to focus on the tires, since the oil issue was bogus. She proceeded to tell me I needed They were having a special on tires she said, which ended that evening. I wanted to go home first, shop around for tires & see where the best deal was. Before I left merchants, they slapped a rejection sticker on my car & I paid $16 for that. Ok, that I understand.\n\nAfter shopping around, merchants buy 2 get 2 tires seemed like the best deal. I had to re arrange my entire work schedule that afternoon to get back to merchants by the end of the day to take advantage of this deal. When I got there, a different customer service representative greeted me & pulled up my profile. \"Oh my gosh, theres so much wrong with your car\" he said. I need new tires...thats IT. Its practically a brand new car. Is he really saying this, i thought? Does he THINK hes getting a sale out of me, just because i'm a girl? Get outta town. I told him I'd talked to another csr earlier & shed explained the \"buy 2 get 2 tires\" deal. So, lets do it & get it over with. He goes, \"yep! thats right. let me get you in our system & we'll get those tires on\". He tells me to sit down & hand him my keys. When I ask him to verify the amount (I was told 3 times that the total, with special, would be $500)...he says, \"800\". I responded, how do you figure that? He says I have to buy the alignment package & the warranty package in order to take advantage of the special. Hm, no one EVER mentioned this to me. In fact, I called again before I headed back to merchants & before I re arranged my entire work schedule in order to verify the price I'd be charged. Somehow, I was misinformed...three times in one day. He then said, \"Well, our price is $800. Sorry.\" \n\nI said thanks, but no thanks, took my keys & left. I only went back to merchants after I had got new tires at another local shop in order for merchants to reinspect & pass my car inspection. \n\nI'm so disapointed in merchants tire & auto in Christiansburg & the way they run their business. You'd think that they'd treat people with respect & not try to rip you off every chance they could, if they wanted to keep their customers. I talked to several of my neighbors after this experience I had with Merchants...turns out, not one of them has gone back to Merchants a second time...because their first visit was just as unpleasant as mine.

However, I've only been here twice, due to the fact that its relatively expensive. I paid my second visit to this restaurant last night. Unfortunately, the lights went out when our food came out. surprisingly however, not only was their backup generator hooked up to a few of the overhead lamps, but it was also hooked to the many HDTV's around the restaurant. smart on their part because the duke v tech game was on and the crowds of rowdy hokie fans over by the bar would have definitely left.\n\nI've read the reviews on this restaurant and one thing stood out to me. Inconsistency. This is definitely accurate. The first time I had the ribs here they were so so, but when I had them again yesterday, it was absolutely amazing. Definitely the best I've ever sunken my teeth in and tastier than the ribs found at TOTS. Although they weren't the fall-off-the-bone type at bull and bones, they were still full of flavor and tender.\n\nWe also had the shrimp and crab dip for the second time which was also delicious, but it was not accompanied with enough bread and also came out lukewarm. Definitely ask for more bread, because we only finished half the dip with the bread that came out with the plate. The dip came out with breadcrumbs on top this time which was odd, but did not really change the flavor.\n\nService was okay, our waiter kept disappearing on us... This is probably because he had to take over our table since our original waiter was not feeling well. \n\nI'm not too big on beer, but my opinion on the beer here is that it IS tasty, but I'd rather go with the beers that taste similar that you can get at the grocery store. For example the sun lit wit is similar to blue moon, and the maroon effect ale is similar to yeungling. From what I hear from friends, most only like two of the beers here. They also have happy hour specials every day of the week except Saturday. Their root beer is also quite tasty as well.\n\nAll in all, this place is like an \"upscale restaurant\" for us college kids, but more of a casual place for older adults. The crowd over by the bar were majority married adults rather than college students.\n\nI'd probably go back another time or two before I graduate this semester just so I can taste those dreamy ribs again.","type":"review","user_id":"XiMjphpRsjC4jK8_4jYQtA","votes":{"cool":0,"funny":0,"useful":1}},

The chips tasted bland and stale, while the salsa was just corn and chopped roma tomatoes that were cold like they were just taken out of the fridge, I would have been happier with a jar of store salsa and a bag of tortilla chips. Entree was the blackened mahi-mahi fish taco with the original caborita. The margarita was sub-par, they had a lot of other choices but I went with a medium one. I can mix a better one myself at home with store margarita mix. The fish taco was decent, a nice amount of zing to it from the spices, but overall had a colder mouthfeel to it. It was about as much as I could expect from seafood in landlocked Blacksburg, VA. \n\nThere aren't too many decent places to eat in Blacksburg, but it has about the same quality as a chain store where it should excel.

So as a Japanese restaurant, I would give it 1 star, but for the food itself, I would give it 4 stars.\n\nThe interior of Kobe is nothing special at all -- in fact, it is really bare, and just looks like another cheap Chinese takeout joint, albeit a spacious one. The presentation of the food is unimpressive too, but somehow, the way they cook the meat/seafood and the rice, and those candied carrots... it somehow keeps you coming back for more. I guess they cook everything hibachi-style, but it has neither the nasty buttery taste or overly expensive pricing of Kabuki in Christiansburg. Meals here are very cheap, perfect for college students. \n\nI've long since graduated from Tech, but I still sometimes get Kobe cravings....","type":"review","user_id":"MGY9Z55I5o7X-8XT0QqOxQ","votes":{"cool":0,"funny":0,"useful":0}},

They were nice and price-matched a radio I had bought at Best Buy, but when I went to get it installed at Best Buy, Best Buy price-matched their deal. So I ended up saving like $35 on an expensive car radio. However, when I returned the car radio from Scotty's they told me it would take FOURTEEN business days for the money to be credited back to me. This is incredibly aggravating as I am a poor college graduate at the moment and I don't really have an extra $200 to throw around.\n\nAlso, they seem like nice salesmen but they tried to pressure and guilt me into using their services. I was put off by their incessant pushing when I was just frustrated and tired of dealing with so many people.\n\nAlso, when you buy and get installation from Best Buy, you have a lifetime warranty on the installation, which means you can go to ANY Best Buy in the country if something gets messed up and they will fix it. Scotty's only has a few locations in Virginia--not so convenient for someone who has no intention of living here for more than 3-4 years while her boyfriend finishes up graduate school at VT.\n\nOverall, just a miserable experience.","type":"review","user_id":"0vz1kjUpqUWJ6C7Bh8IrMw","votes":{"cool":0,"funny":0,"useful":2}},

The cheese was not evenly distributed as one bite came out with cold ricotta and the next, hot mozzarella.  The chicken piccata appeared to have some garlic, but not much.  No sign of fresh parsley, basil or any other herb or spice.  I'm used to Italian restaurants that grow their own spices in the front and the aroma draws customers inside.  The marinara sauce tasted like it came from a can.\n\nAs we sat with empty drinks waiting for someone to offer a refill, the salad arrived.  Yes, apparently at this restaurant, the salad comes AFTER the entree.  The waiter finally came by and asked if the kitchen had just brought the salad and we said \"yes\".  No apology.  No offer to take that off the bill.  Just an \"Oh\".\n\nThe atmosphere isn't bad.  It has potential.

It's a very cool place, and their music selection is good as well.\n\nThe first time I went, my server was incredibly attentive - after noticing we were still looking at the menu, he didn't ask if we were ready, but rather waited until we closed up the menus and looked ready to order.  He refilled our waters without us calling for him, and even brought along takeout boxes with our receipt.  When he came back with the receipt again, he brought a bag for our takeout boxes.  All without us asking!\nThe second time, the service was good, but definitely not as good.  \n\nThe beauty of this place is the size of its menu - it serves mostly sandwiches, but there is pasta and other choices as well if you're really interested.  The first time I ordered the Titanic sandwich, and the second time I made my own sandwich.  Both times, the bread was soft (even with the French bread, which is usually crunchy and hurts my teeth with its goodness) but crunchy, the meat generously given, and the cheese melted to perfection.  Yum!  If you order their sandwiches, they come with a side, and if you make your own sandwich, they come with chips.  \nThe servings are more than generous - only half of the sandwich feels like a meal in itself.  Both times I've been there, I saved half my sandwich after being full, and had a very good dinner that night!\n\nI also ordered an appetizer to share with my friends - we chose the spinach-archichoke dip with pita bread, which was really good.  Spindip is usually my appetizer of choice to \"assess\" a place, and this one was very good.  The bread to dip ratio was perfect both times, and the dip itself was very good - not too cheesy, or purely spinach.  I'll try to give more appetizers more tries my next time here!\n\nThis is definitely a nice place for a college town - check out the discounts for the day (they have one for every day).

I think some bands might have a good time playing here, and a lot of the people seemed happy that there was music, but really, it's not conducive to really paying attention to song-lyrics. There is just too much talking and clinking of knives and forks and the sound from the kitchen carries all the way across the restaurant.

It was nice at the end of the night to find that all the diners had appreciated me!\n\nAfter the gig, I chose a bottle from the great beer selection and ordered Nori-crusted tofu with a soba noodle cake and wasabi aoili that was excelent. I think there was a vegetable with it, but I can't remember now. Super-yummy, though. \n\nThe woman I was staying with suggested that Gillie's was the best place in town for breakfast, so we went back the next day.

The beer selection is my favorite part (obviously).

The place seems to be very understaffed for how packed it gets. The Bartenders are also the wait staff and food runners.  The place could be a 4-5 star if they had better service.

Gillie's is the only vegetarian restaurant in Blacksburg, the kind of place that is ubiquitous in college towns across the States. Usually these college towns have more than one option like Gillie's, but this is it for us. We have a couple health food stores, a farmer's market, and one veg restaurant.\n\nThat being said, I wish I could give this place 3.5 stars, or even three. I need to give it four because it's the only game in town. It competes with places to eat like Sharkey's, El Rod's, and Moe's. But I think it gets away with serving sub-par food in the name of being an \"alternative.\" Here are a few recent dishes...\nEggs, Biscuit, and Potatoes - Scrambled eggs were rubbery, biscuit divine, potatoes underseasoned.\nNori encrusted tofu, Soba-noodle cake, asparagus - Tofu delicious, if miminal. The strange, unidentified grey patty *I Think* was buckwheat noodles overseasoned with loads of cumin. Asparagus stalks edible, although curious as a side since they are out-of-season.\nPoached Egg, Biscuit, Grits - Poached egg perfect over delicious biscuit. Grits completely unedible - although seasoned perfectly, the consistency was of crunchy, undercooked rice. Full disclosure: I'm a northerner. However, in my years of traveling and cooking and voracious eating, I've never had grits that consistency. Maybe that's how Beamer likes 'em served. I don't know. \nGillie's Burger with red cabbage slaw - Delicious burger. However, the half-plate filled with raw cabbage is unnecessary. The cabbage is shredded into such large pieces, that one must cut into it if it is to be eaten. Additionally, because the shred is so large, there is only a slight glaze of seasoning on the cabbage. It goes uneaten on many plates.\nSmoked Henderson - There is too much going on, too many flavors, and too many different sizes of food. Think of a dish that takes all of your leftovers - smoked salmon with sauteed onions, fresh garlic, tomatoes, spinach, black olives, and artichokes - and chucks them into penne pasta and topped with feta cheese. These things don't cling to the pasta well. Everything is cut into such large sizes (including the large penne pasta) requiring a knife and fork in order to assemble these bits and pieces. The \"white wine sauce\" adds very little flavor, and the pasta alone is very bland. \n\nIt seems like every time we go to Gillie's, servers forget to bring water and cutlery. I know they're busy, and I know they're artists, but cutlery is essential for this type of business to succeed. \n\nOn the plus side, there is live music, and a fabulous person who books a variety of acts. There is an excellent beer list, with many local and imported brews. Desserts are very good - I recently had a piece of the rhubarb-peach pie. The crust was flaky, not tough. The pastry/filling ratio was perfect.\n\nOn the whole, Gillie's should work. It seems like they need to do a little menu revamping and some basic culinary instruction to the kitchen staff, but that's about it.","type":"review","user_id":"ajb0eqA8dKQZQyn9dtjEkQ","votes":{"cool":0,"funny":0,"useful":0}},

Somehow I ordered a salad that normally came with some sort of dressing on it.  But I wanted a balsamic vinegrette instead.  and on the side.

Expected mediocre food, but was pleasantly surprised. The burger, which was a mushroom-seitan-grain patty, was awesome, and the perfect texture. The bun was really good too, a multi-grain one I assume, and was perfectly toasted, providing a great textural combination with the patty. Herbed mayo was on it, but I saw the salad dressings on the menu, and got a side of lemon-tahini, which I added to the sandwich. Also has a mixed green salad, which contained many fresh lettuces and veggies, and a bowl of the chickpea-squash (butternut?) soup, which was also good. Really nice to be able to order carrot juice, as I downed the whole thing while waiting for my food. This place is a godsend in the Virginia countryside, and a true gem for all the conscious eaters going to Tech. Granted most students are probably meat-and-potatoes eaters, but with more and more college kids going vegetarian, it's just really nice to have veggie food of this quality, out in Blacksburg, which to me seems like the middle of nowhere (no offense). I live in the Bay Area CA, the self proclaimed mecca of vegetarian eating, and this place could stand up against the best of them. \n\nIf you are a Tech student, and at all concerned about healthy eating, go here.

They offer daycare at certain times, so you can work out while the kids play. Daily use lockers in a clean but no frills locker room (bring your own lock). You can also rent lockers for a monthly or yearly rate on a limited basis. They also offer towel service for a fee. \n\nThis site is typically full of college students and more than a few serious weight lifters, but don't worry they won't bite (mostly). If you intimidate easily, this might not be the weight room for you. At a minimum you are going to want to bring a friend. **Warning: When Tech's semesters start up or Spring Break is approaching the gym can get really really crowded at peak hours.**\n\n- The CRC: It couldn't be less intimidating. It is much much smaller but still has most of the equipment you could want. This crowd is older and mostly professional types. This is a great site for someone wanting to start with a personal trainer.\n\n- Personal Trainers: I have been working with Eric for about a month now. We meet twice a week and have set up a outside-of-meetings cardio schedule for me. Without his guidance I know I wouldn't be doing any weight lifting right now. Eric is very willing to work with your specific needs, so just tell him what your goals are and what is or isn't working for you. The personal training fees are very reasonable.\n\nThe price for a membership is fantastic if you are a student and quite reasonable even if you are just paying month to month as a regular community member.","type":"review","user_id":"Of1gS4IfNhszA8tn6KNLXQ","votes":{"cool":0,"funny":0,"useful":1}},

The quality of the ingredients, however, makes it definitely worth the price. Plus, I didn't feel like a total glutton after eating my two tacos, side, and complimentary basket of baked chips with corn. \n\nThe atmosphere of Cabo Fish Tabo is very relaxing.

I say it has the best sushi in town and most choices too! And I haven't found a place that has better seafood. Their wait staff is also really friendly. \n\nIf you're a fan of oysters, they have the best tasting ones in town. On Monday they have a 40 cent oyster deal too! \n\nHowever, there's a good bit you have to take into consideration when going. \n\n1. It's not a cheap eat. Most main course prices do range $15-25. So if you're looking to not spend a bunch, you'll have to really be picky here to stay relatively cheap. So if you're a college student or a broke grad, you might want to wait until someone with more disposable income can treat you. It's worth it!\n\n2. The atmosphere is really relaxed. The staff doesn't rush you. So if there's a lot of people dining there, you can expect a wait. A long wait if you go during on a weekend (especially during football games) on a holiday. During the week it isn't bad. It's also not one of the biggest restaurants in Blacksburg, so if you have a big party, it might take a while to get you a table.\n\n3. Sure the service isn't the fastest in the world, and is a little slower than I would like (hence it getting 4 and not 5 stars). However, like I said before, they don't rush you. So if you're in there to watch a game while you have your meal, you can stay for the whole game and not have an annoying waiter try to rush you out.","type":"review","user_id":"AoYJoCfMCRmu2TBaCDbO-Q","votes":{"cool":0,"funny":0,"useful":0}},

Bull and Bones was the hands down favorite.  They definitely got their name out.  I was in town for the VTech/ Duke game and my friend and I decided to hit this place up for some food.  Note:  Duke really sucks at football.\n\nWhen we walked in, we were quoted a wait time of an hour and 15 minutes.  However, the bar area was first come first serve.  The wait didn't end up being that long, which is a good thing because I was contemplating stealing wings off a guy's plate.  There was also a wing on the floor that I stared at for a good 10 minutes.\n\nMy friend and I decided to go with the ribs and ordered up a bunch of wings as well.  You know it is a good day when you end it being surrounded by meat.  The wings are pretty good.  Big size, smokey flavor...I would definitely recommend the house bbq wings.  The ribs were ginormous as well.  However, the ribs might not be what most people expect of ribs.  These ribs are grilled which leave them a little tough.  You have to tear the meat off the bones with your teeth...which doesn't bother me at all being the carnivore that I am.  Sometimes I like my ribs where the meat doesn't fall off the bone.  The cole slaw was ok.  I liked the sweet potato casserole side...tasted like a sweet potato stuffing.  We also had the Sun Lit Wit brews since my friend is a fan of Blue Moon.  Definitely pretty good, especially if you like Belgian wheats.  The next time I'm in town, I'm going to try their sampler which consists of 6 small glasses of their brews.\n\nDecor is not unlike that of a Gordon Biersch or other brew pubs.  Service was excellent.  I think the bar area could be organized better to allow for more standing room.  Also, they should have a few more bartenders especially on game days.  Parking isn't too bad, the shopping center has quite a few lots although you might find yourself walking a little bit.\n\nI like brew pubs like this.  Good atmosphere and good meat.  Yeah, don't go here ordering salad because as we all know...you don't win friends with salad.","type":"review","user_id":"a4nhy231AX3j3LqnWKW3Ng","votes":{"cool":1,"funny":2,"useful":1}},

It is just about the ONLY place in Blacksburg that sells premium pet food.  For about a year, I had been driving from Blacksburg to Salem to find a store to get dog food from.  Kibbles on Main helps my dog's boarding facility, and I found their name there.  Thought I'd stop in to see what they're about and support local business.  To my wonder and amazement, I saw a huge selection of premium foods; my eyes lit up.  Quickly, however, they dimmed.  Though they had a huge selection, they didn't carry my brand.  After speaking with Dennis, though, he told me that they could order it and keep it in stock.  Seriously??  Now, instead of driving 30 miles to get food, I only have to drive three.  The prices are competitive and in line with what you'd pay anywhere else, but it's a moot point anyway.  The savings in gas, not to mention the time, is return on investment enough.\n\nI would definitely recommend this place to anyone.  They have the best selection of premium pet food and healthy snacks in the entire region.  If they don't, by chance, carry what you're looking for, they will after you ask them.  Prices are the same anywhere else, but you're supporting a local small business which is always a plus.  And the service is always friendly and helpful.  What more could you want?

I don't want anyone to think that it's not welcoming to college students, but its more for date night and parent visits for the usual college co-ed (I know there are you exceptions out there who enjoy a nice Sangiovese instead of a Natty Light!).\n\nThe refreshed interior of the old Bogen's building is bright, cheery, and welcoming while retaining the craftsman style character of the original structure. The antique baby grand piano on the lower level adds character and ambiance, even when it's not being used. Feel free to tickle the ivories if you're in the mood to entertain, fellow diners will definitely show their appreciation. \n\nThe wine lounge, which is a first for our area and a very welcome addition, has an adult, contemporary feel with deep grape colored walls and accents of creamy white leather throughout. The wine list is extensive yet approachable. You'll find reconizable varieties for those who like to play it safe or, if you're more adventerous, let the experienced & knowledgeable staff recommend something new. The have most of the wines available as tastes or glasses instead of just a few house wines. You really can try new things, and if you don't like it, you're only out about $4 instead of $40 for a bottle. The tapas style menu encourages you to sample a different wine with each dish while sitting back and and enjoying a conversation. It is a great place for drinks after work, to meet a first date, or enjoy a ladies night out. You're not going to have random strangers hitting on you, drunk college girls spilling drinks everywhere or noisy crowds watching sports over your shoulder. A definite upgrade for Blacksburg.\n\nThe traditional bar, Frank's at 622 North, is located on the opposite end of the wine lounge has new flat screens everywhere, so you won't miss a minute of your game. While I'm not a pool player, there are several new tables that seem to be quite popular. The bar is huge and my favorite spot is the smaller bar that's by the door leading out to the parking lot. It seems to be quieter and you can have a conservation with the friendly bar staff and your friends. As a non-smoker, I was honestly worried when i heard that they were going to allow smoking in Frank's, but it really isn't bad at all. They have a great ventilation system so the only time I've noticed the smell is when my friends are smoking right beside me. It definitely doesn't deter me from hanging out there (pre the smoking ban in VA, there were definitely some Blacksburg bars I avoided like the plague.)\n\nAs for the food, it's very exciting to see fresh ingredients, housemade dressings, sauces, desserts, and thought put into a menu. I love that the menu changes frequently with new additions and nightly specials to keep people coming back and prevent bordom. It's also refreshing to not have to sort through an 8 page menu. I like the simplicity. It shows me that the Chef is paying attention to the ingredients available to him, listening to the customers that are coming in and very focused on sending out great, quality food.  The desserts are always amazing. Get the peanutbutter pie if it's on the menu!\n\nWhile I truely believe that this is one of, if not the best restaurant in Blacksburg, no where is perfect. I agree that Frank's could use a little more attention to the decor and environment. I'm sure the staff have a few kinks to work out, and every restaurant's menu can always be tweeked. But after only being open for less than 2 months, this place is leaps and bounds above its competitors who have been in business for years. They don't seem to be settling for the cookie cutter model. We have enough of those restaurants here. If you're looking for an experience unlike any other in Blacksburg, check it out. It won't be a one time visit.","type":"review","user_id":"nwJ0ukm4mhG0PhJILAl-Ug","votes":{"cool":0,"funny":0,"useful":1}},

No.  I've had burgers at Mikes with more grease but (sorry Mike) these are better.  By far.\n\nExpect to pay more than a typical fast food burger though.  Fries cost a bit more than normal too but they are better than normal.  Try the spiced fries too (not by that name but that's what they are).  Any toppings on the burgers or hot dogs a free with the exception of bacon and cheese which isn't considered a topping.  They use to have beer (YEAH!) but they dropped that (awww...) 'cause I guess they weren't selling enough.  They ought to add hand made milk shakes.  It would go perfect with what they have.\n\nAtmosphere is like a large fast-food without the kitsch.  You can leave the peanut shells on he floor.  That probably helps when they sweep up anyway.  Large open area with movable tables and chairs.  Oddly, they have a fireplace with wood but it's never been used.  From what I can see it is functional though.  They could have used it this winter but they'd need to put a guard around it.  Maybe that's why they don't use it.\n\nTypical meal for two kids and two adults, $25.  Unless their price goes up, this is a deal.

That could be just me though, I guess fast service is probably one of their priorities... but I wouldn't mind a slower pace in there.\n\nODB also offers samples daily... but it seems that its not actually encouraged for people to participate in the sampling... and barely any time to take in what you sampled before being asked what you'd like. \n\nI would like to see ODB open a smaller location in the downtown area of Blacksburg, so that students and visiting families could stop in and have a bite to eat, without having to drive to their actual location down South Main.\n\ncheck out their website for lots more details about pastries and other goodies... they also seem to update it pretty regularly with lunch and breakfast specials.\n\nhttp://www.odbb.com/","type":"review","user_id":"scL6AqiMiYt5I9H-RJjfUw","votes":{"cool":0,"funny":0,"useful":1}},

The side of pasta was incredibly small. Not even enough to coat the bottom of one of those silver delivery containers. There was hardly any sauce on the pasta or on the eggplant and when that was combined with the burnt taste of the eggplant, everything came off as dry. The garlic bread was properly portioned, but had the opposite issue in that it was doughy and undercooked and rather bland for garlic bread.

My total always ends up costing less than I think it will because I only buy what I need.\n\nTips: \n- Get a membership.

The wait staff can be slow but isn't always.\n\nThe food here is typical American/Italian and the beer selection is very good.  It's a friendly place to take the kids even and it won't break the bank if you watch what you choose.  I wouldn't go downstairs though unless you want the typical college bar experience.  Upstairs is a nice, if crowded sit down place with mirrors on both walls that make it look bigger. \n\nTheir chef/s do a good job and their pasta is good.  Some entrees are from frozen ingredients though and you can tell if you know what to look for but they still taste good.  Their pita pizza is some of the best pizza in the NRV and I've had a lot around the area.\n\nThe beer selection is top of the line both on-tap and in bottles.  I don't really know about the rest of their drink selection as I haven't had it for over a decade.  Happy hour is at a nice price point and their dollar bottled beer special has never steered me wrong.  You can't be cheaper than that for beer.\n\nThe noise can get high at times due to the crowds, sometimes the live band, and the reverberant walls/mirrors but it's never gotten deafening or hurtful.\n\nThe wait staff can be slow; they have to take care of two floors of people - the bar downstairs and the more normal restaurant upstairs.  I feel the cooks are likely responsible for some of the delays too for similar reasons.  But I've only had to ask them to hurry up once.  They haven't been slow all the time either.  My suggestion is to arrive early, about 5 or 5:30 and it will speed things up.  Also, Fridays and Saturdays are slower IMO.\n\nIf you watch what you order you can get by for about $45 for two kids and two adults including tip.  That's with beer.  Of course, if you order dessert or buy more expensive entrees it can go over $50.  If everyone gets pita pizza and water it will be less.  For this economy, that's a really good deal.\n\nThe food is a solid three stars but the beer and price make it worth four.","type":"review","user_id":"VVzG_2ZQg63rOBfBkS6VLA","votes":{"cool":0,"funny":0,"useful":0}},

We were really happy to see several breakfast options marked as \"can be made animal free\".   I was immediately bummed to find out there wasn't a vegan grits option or pancake option (so damn easy to make vegan), but we pressed on. Husband ordered the tofu scramble with home fries and soy milk, and I got a veganized version of some other thing that ended up looking exactly like my husband's dish, but with just cubed tofu.   What bummed me out was the only vegan bread they offered was dry, toasted baguette slices. It seems like if you're going to specifically tout yourself as having vegan options, at least keep some vegan margarine on hand so us vegans don't have to nibble on dry white bread. The tofu \"scramble\" (actually cubed, not scrambled, but I know this can be a regional thing) was pretty good all slathered in BBQ sauce. The home fries were absolutely perfect. Super greasy and really awesome.  We were brought room temperature soy milk along with ice filled glasses. The server told us that they didn't have any soymilk in stock, so they stepped out to get us some. A nice gesture, but I wonder why no soymilk? Not enough vegans in this college town?\n\nThe service was friendly, and our bellies were filled and ready for our 10 hour drive back home. If I lived locally, I probably wouldn't be a regular at Gillie's, but it was a nice place to get a vegan bite while traveling.","type":"review","user_id":"1GQ1ah6xGho7CcKzCzntXw","votes":{"cool":1,"funny":0,"useful":0}},

Each time, I hope for a better experience and have yet to receive it.  I won't go over the other times I have been here since they are not as fresh in my brain as the previous weekends visit.\n\nI debated about going back to B&B and thought maybe we should go to Outback, Texas Roadhouse, or Texas Steakhouse however we did end up at B&B.  I \"called ahead\"  for a table which is pointless as it is not a reservation and only serves to put your name on the waiting list once you arrive.  Regardless, since there were two of us the wait as initially told to be 40 minutes was actually 15 minutes.  This allowed me to grab a Maroon Effect Ale from the bar.  One side note here is that the bartenders suck.  As I patiently waited at the bar for 10 minutes with money in hand in making eye contact with 2 of the 3 bartenders, it fell on blind eyes.  Only after 5 people that showed up after me were served, my order was taken.\n\nWe were seated (in front of the kitchen) and given menus.  The waiter (probably extremely busy) did not come over to the table for about 10 minutes or so.  This really wasn't an issue, more like a nuisance.  We ended up ordering another round of drinks (Maroon Effect and Sun Lit Wit) which took about 10 more minutes and followed that up with our dinner orders.  I ordered the rib eye (medium) with roasted vegetables, a crab cake, and a Caesar salad.  My dining partner ordered the sirloin (medium) with a baked potato.\n\nMy Caesar salad came out about a minute after I ordered and it probably took about 20 - 25 minutes thereafter to get our entrees.  The salad was nothing to write home about, consisting of lettuce, croutons, a small amount of grated cheese and a ho-hum Caesar dressing.  When our meal arrived, it was nice and hot.  I cut into my steak and it was cooked exactly right.  The taste was nothing notable, just meat.  My friends sirloin however was medium well to well done.  They commented on it being dry.  While it did not stop them from eating (as they were hungry), they were not happy.  My roasted vegetables were average at best.  They tasted like the seasoned frozen vegetables you heat up in the microwave.  The crab cake was good but tartar sauce tasted more like mayonnaise.\n\nThe biggest complaint I have about this place is the quantity versus the price versus the quality.  I would have no problem paying $57 (2 people) for a good meal with less food or $57 for an ok meal with more food but I don't like paying $57 for an ok meal with less food.  I knew the rib eye was 12 oz going in however I did not know the crab cake was going to be slightly larger than a half dollar coin (about as thick too) or the roasted vegetables were going to be about 3 forks worth.  The Caesar salad wasn't exactly big either but whatever.\n\nThe strongest points of this establishment are its beers.  The taste and style are great, with the price being justifiable.  It isn't outrageous but it's well above Blacksburg's pricing scheme.  The weakest points are its food.  While B&B delivers on one end, it fails on the other.\n\n2.5 stars, try it once for food, and multiple times for beers\n\nnote: the cost breakdown was about $40 for food, $9 for drinks, and $8 for tip.","type":"review","user_id":"--ugitI7hU4y2v81tSS7pg","votes":{"cool":0,"funny":0,"useful":0}},

In fact our experience here just made me love this chain even more!\n\nWe ate there last night. 3 adults (one of our kids is 15), and 4 children (ages 8-10). The total bill for 7 of us came to $ 40 and some change. \n\nThey not only happily GIVE a military discount but if you are in uniform, your meal is free. We ate here to celebrate when my husband came home from Iraq, literally as soon as he got off the plane so he was still in uniform and they gave him his meal for free. \n\nThis restaurant chain had never disappointed with it's cleanliness, charming atmosphere, and impeccable service or price.\n\nThe greatest thing about Red Robin for bigger families is their bottomless meals! Seriously as a mother of 5, this concept is un-heard of!!! They have a childrens menu where the kids can color it and circle what they want to eat (takes the pain out of offering for 4 smaller kids), bring out cups with lids, AND (one of the kids just noticed last night) that they have a game of I spy on the cups to keep the kids busy!!! Kudos to the person who thought of that!! Instead of listening to who was touching who and who was being mean we heard, \"cool!!!\" While the game occupied them and opened them up to looking around the restaurant at all the neat stuff they have on the walls. Before we knew it.....DING....food was served.\n\nWhen you first walk in they have a tv in the floor! My kids are obsessed with standing on it and before we know it, we are being seated without having to hear the typical \"we're hungry\" that parents usually hear while standing in line to be seated. And as my son informed me, they have a tv in the boys bathroom...so be prepared for your kid to keep having to go to the bathroom, lol.\n\nTwo of my kids ordered the cheese pizza, one ordered the cheeseburger, and the other ordered the mac and cheese. All but one got the steak fries and the other got apple slices. ALL BOTTOMLESS! If you haven't experienced this yet, everything that the kids ordered....they could have as much as they wanted for no extra charge! My son ended up getting a second cheeseburger and the other a second pizza. You absolutely can not beat that especially for larger families when your kids are going through a growth spurt and one portion isn't quite filling.\n\nThey also have bottomless drinks, I just dont remember which ones but the different flavored Iced Teas were on there and they are good!!! \n\nThey also serve mixed drinks which is very nice for Mom and Dad!\n\nWhile we were sitting there eating, the Manager came around and stopped at every table to personally check on the customers needs. He stopped at our table, joked around with the kids and continuously asked if we needed anything and how our service was. That was very nice and made us feel like our every need was met. I watched the manager walk around to every table to check on his customers, it kind of made us feel like we were part of the Red Robin family! \n\nExcellent parking, smoke-free environment, super friendly staff, great food, great prices, fun atmosphere, comfortable dining experience, and not just kid-friendly....KID WELCOMING without the adults feeling like it's a kids restaurant. I can't say enough good things about Red Robin, and have not one bad thing to say and we've had the RR EXPERIENCE about 4 times in two different locations. \n\nAnd they also do sing Happy Birthday and I think you get a complimentary desert and they have a RR online club for deals.","type":"review","user_id":"3KU1QjFCtLHMxHQUOaRz4w","votes":{"cool":0,"funny":0,"useful":0}},

I've been here many many times and have always WANTED to like it. They have beer and barbeque...how could they screw up barbeque?\n\nThe food is ok to sub-par. I had their special tonight. \"Slow smoked sirloin\" with grilled zucchini and garlic mashed potatoes. Sounds delicious right? Well, not really. The plate came with 6 unevenly cut slices of zucchini that had been steamed and then slapped on the grill for char-marks. The garlic mash was indeed garlic-laden, however had the consistency of lumpy glue. I ordered by steak medium rare but it came out well done and pre-sliced. I hate when they slice my steak for me, but that's not the point. The \"smoked\" flavor was atrocious. It was like they made a fire with plastic and then threw the steak on for a few hours. The only way I got the thing down was to cover up the \"smoke\" flavor with their vinegar based spicy barbeque sauce. \n\nMy friend got the pulled pork plate. That's a dish that is always on the menu so you think they would have perfected it. Again, no. The \"roasted vegetables\" it came with were still swimming in the water they used to boil them. The baked beans on the plate tasted like it came out of a can...actually the canned stuff is better than what was on his plate. The pork was just \"meh\". He also poured the mustard-spicy sauce on it and that made the whole thing taste considerably better. \n\nThe only great thing I've ever had here were the smoked wings. They come in a ton of flavors and taste great going down with a cold beer. Oh that's what's good there too: the beer.\n\nIn short, it's not worth what they charge for, so eat the food at your own risk. The happy hour is ridiculously good, though.

Being from the San Gabriel Valley in CA (where you'll find some of the best Chinese restaurants outside of China) I tend to agree with the previous reviewer, but everything is relative. For one, food in Blacksburg just generally sucks. There really isn't a \"good\" restaurant in town (and by good, I'm coming from a pretentious California food-snob perspective) and that includes Blacksburg's sad attempts at any kind of ethnic cuisine.\n\nChinese food here just isn't great. It's pretty much all Americanized (unless you're able to read the Chinese menu at Charlie's Chinese in Christiansburg) and even for Americanized Chinese, it's not very good. \n\nSo what's good about Double Dragon that I'm willing to give it three stars? Well, it's fast, edible, and fresh-tasting. For the most part, the food isn't terribly bland like most of the food (Asian or otherwise) in the area, and has flavors somewhat approximating Chinese food. \n\nWhat I like: \n-Dumplings in hot chili oil- pretty decent, actually good for the area\n-Beef in scallion sauce- it's got flavor and stuff, so I like it.\n-Orange chicken- tastes like your typical orange chicken, which is a good thing for Blacksburg.\n\nWhat's okay:\n-fried dumplings- get them from Chinese Kitchen, they're much better there.\n-Broccoli in garlic sauce- the garlic sauce is bland, but at least the broccoli tends to be crisp\n-Lo Mein- this is something you don't find so much on the West Coast, but it's kinda like a mushier chow mein. You can probably get it better at other restaurants in the area.\n\nSo... Yeah, do I recommend it? Sure. If you want Chinese-American food, and you're stuck in Blacksburg, this place is totally fine. It's good, even. But if you can hop on the next jet outta Blacksburg and go to a real city with real food, you should do that instead.","type":"review","user_id":"HpKwFDZw5BaWHat_4g-ufA","votes":{"cool":0,"funny":1,"useful":0}},

Overcooked wings with almost no sauce on them, or drowned in sauce are normal. A decent amount of the time though you'll get wings that are done about right. The wait time after an order is placed is completely random. I have waited over an hour for food (in a near empty restaurant).

Bull and Bones had a lot of potential and fell short in almost all categories both times I have been there.\n\nMOOD: Brewery restaurant feel with the stills, large bar, tall tables and the restaurant half. Both times I have been to the bar areas, as they have a much better wall of TVs that is actually very decent for watching sport events. For this purpose, this may be the best place in Blacksburg to watch games while having a drink and munchies.\n\nSERVICE: Hit or miss. The first time I came was the first week the restaurant opened and my service was terrible enough that I could have gotten a free meal easily (I ordered an appetizer and it took over an hour to get it, to a point that I didn't want it anymore). The second time things were a bit more timely, so I won't hold them being new against them too much. On to what matters:\n\nBEER: They have a regular selection and a seasonal. Many of the regulars taste very similar to each other, I was hoping more experimentation with styles and a stronger selection. Indeed, any of their beers beats the american macros you can get anywhere, but they aren't quite better than something as simple as a guinness or sam adams draft. The stout is quite good, but it isn't very drinkable with food. I suppose the lunch pale ale would be my most balanced choice, but I would prefer Rock Bottom's beer selections. \n\nThe worst part about it is that their happy hour is basically nonexistent. They say they have one, but I haven't seen it yet. The advantage of having a brewery/restaurant is that you can discount your beer, however I haven't paid less than 4.50 for a pint where at Rock Bottom I could get 1.50 pints and cheaper food during the happy hour.  \n\nFOOD: It's pretty standard. I didn't find anything on the menu that stands out at me and makes my mouth water and want to order it, the appetizers were just OK and my burger was overcooked. Also, again I must complain about the lack of a decent happy hour really killing this place for me. \n\nAll in all, if you want to watch sports you can go here or to buffalo wild wings. They have better beer, but it's not worth the extra $$ they charge for it. I won't consider going unless they have 2 dollar pints and cheap nachos, it just doesn't taste good enough to justify spending more at this place.","type":"review","user_id":"ZPpuU4Kz1SrFTrKDQ9S3AQ","votes":{"cool":1,"funny":1,"useful":2}},

It's a Greek and \"Italian\" kind of hybrid restaurant. They occasionally have a cool Southern style band come in and play live music, which is a great cultural experience for someone who's not from the area. They have a very good beer selection and some good value options. Service at this place is pretty nonexistant though. You pretty much seat yourself and if the wait staff happens to notice that you exist then they come and begrudgingly take your order. They rarely ever check up on you to see if you need anything and good luck getting them to bring you a check. Odds are you'll have to flag someone down yourself. They have 1 single unisex bathroom, which isn't exactly kept to the most hygienic of standards. If you want to go and sit at the bar to watch a game -- good luck. No one in that place has any idea as to how to operate their TV. The subtitles have been streaming on the one TV for about a year and half now without sound. It's an issue that the ownership just seems to not notice or ignore. They also seem to have an ant issue, because every time that I sit at the bar I always notice an ant or two stroll by. \n            The first time I went, I ordered the Mousakka, which was a menu special for that particular day. Their's consisted of eggplant, ground beef, cheese, and sausage all sort of layered together. I love all of those ingredients individually so I thought why not. They bring you a plate of it, which is a solid 6 inches thick and was clearly baked in the oven. The result, the interior is ice cold while the tops and sides are piping hot. When I came back months later, I ordered the baked ziti with meatballs, something I had been craving. I was expecting a nice plate of ziti with a few meatballs on top and the whole thing coated with mozzarella cheese. Instead, I get the baked ziti with meatballs Mousakka style! It was a 6 inch thick lasagna looking dish that even had the meatballs inside of it. This time though, I had the opposite issue. The exterior was burnt while the interior was warm. The meatballs were comparable to the ones that you buy at Subway or some lousy sub shop. They are absolutely clueless when it comes to cooking Italian style food or running a restaurant in general.","type":"review","user_id":"4Nb4nr3QYwIrQHTMgz_VGQ","votes":{"cool":0,"funny":0,"useful":0}},

They are super super slow.  One night I was downstairs and I was trying for about 45 minutes to pay for my beer.  I must have asked each bartender 5 times to bring the check.  Finally, I just gave up and walked out.  I felt a little guilty for walking out but I didn't have all night to sit there and wait for them to get their act together.  And then most recently our table ordered a pizza, some soup, and cucumber dip with pita bread.  The soup and cucumber dip came out fast, but then all of a sudden we were waiting for 35 minutes to get our pizza.  The server never questioned why the tables that arrives after us were receiving their food before us.  Needless to say, we finally got his attention and said we didn't want the pizza and that we wanted the checks.  So we told him which food belonged to which people and which card to charge.  He got this wrong and charged the wrong amounts on each card.\n\nI'm not so sure if I'll be going back.

While the toppings sound like something that I would enjoy eating, they didn't taste all that fresh and there wasn't nearly enough of them to feel like I was getting the proper flavor from all of the veggies.\n\nAnother strike against PK's, their crust had a horrendous texture. Very tough and chewy, it took some major arm muscles to cut into with a knife and then even more effort to chew it all up.

I felt since this place was known for their Mediterranean food I'd go for that, asked the waiter what in his opinion was the best on the menu and he recommended their 'mixed-grill' platter.\n\nThis included:\n-2 skewers of mixed seasoned chicken and steak and various veggies\n-a pita the size of a barstool seat (im not kidding)\n-a good size pile of hummus with olive oil and paprika\n-a salad made with romaine\n\nThe meat was extremely well seasoned and juicy, the pita was fresh from the oven and hot, the hummus was tangy and went well with everything, and the salad was made with romaine as opposed to worthless iceberg.\n\nAll of this was $9.95!!  I can't stress enough that this is THE BEST value in Blacksburg in my opinion.  \n\nBottom Line: This place has your standard Mediterranean/Lebanese fair and knows how to do it well.  The service is a little slow, but is totally worth the wait when your food comes.  The value of the meal I ordered is unbeatable, I cannot vouch for the rest of the menu.  A nice break from the hamburgers and french fries and subs that Blacksburg normally offers.","type":"review","user_id":"zNV3YeyLDsfN16j9d5lzrA","votes":{"cool":0,"funny":0,"useful":2}},

I ultimately decided on a passion fruit flavor.

I personally was not a fan of the bubbles, but that's more personal preference.\n\nThe service was a little weird.

For the other dish, the scallops with porcini mushroom pierogi, every thing was spot-on -- the scallops were seared right, the sauce was nice and complemented the rest of the meal really well (I assume the artichoke hearts in the sauce were canned, but everything else was fresh).\n\nTo top it off, we got a seasonal blackberry creme brulee that hit the spot -- not too heavy, and the blackberry flavor was great.\n\nThe service was just fine, and our waiter was friendly.  The only knock on the place was that it can be fairly loud -- the restaurant wasn't full, but the sound just carries in that space, largely because there's not much to absorb it, and the walls (metallic?) seemed to bounce the sound right off.  \n\nI haven't tried the sushi, but the seafood entrees were really delicious (although they were each $20 or so).","type":"review","user_id":"U7LPGxc39wPCGJ4D4dnx9A","votes":{"cool":0,"funny":0,"useful":0}},

This place by far has the best tasting coffee in town (and I believe I've been to every coffee shop in town). It's brewed on sight and there's a huge variety. The cafe is impeccably clean and there's a lot of great seating, particularly at their counter. Their hours are fantastic, particularly for early risers such as myself -- I believe they open at 6am (although I'm not a fan of the 10PM close time near a university, but to be fair, every cafe in town closes at around that hour). \n           Now for the negatives. The food is really lousy. The sandwiches are completely boring and unoriginal and honestly -- anyone is perfectly capable of making one of their sandwiches at home for a 5th the price. It's really just bland cold cuts from any grocery store. I can't really compliment them on their breakfast items as they don't really appear to make any of it themselves. The pastries are shipped in and covered with this tacky looking clear wrap. The same thing applies to the bagels -- imported and clear wrapped. Their oatmeal is boxed --  straight out of the grocery store. Honestly, if they want a 4th star, they need to really improve on the food side. \n           The other big negative there is service. The people who work there are professional and take your order, but they're all pretty introverted. I've been going there sporadically for about 2 years and I don't think any of them know my name or care to know. I order the same exact thing every time I go in and I still get asked by them what I want everyday and I'm pretty confident that they really have no idea what I want. I stopped going there for about a 3 month stretch and came back and there wasn't a \"Hey long time no see,\" or \"Hey where have you been.\" It was like they had never seen me before and the scary part is is that I've actually had conversations with a few of them. You can have an entire conversation with someone who works there -- see them the next day -- and they'll completely forget who you are. I mean, I don't want them to have artificial personalities like most Starbucks employees where they're fake nice to you, but Jeez I've been going there for 2 years you should at least recognize me. They're like robots. \n           I would imagine that their robotic personalities stem from the top. The owner Scott seems to run a tight ship, but he's the only aggressive introvert I've ever seen in my life. He hardly ever utters a word, but when say a telemarketer calls he'll snap at them with the ferocity of a drill sergeant. I've had one bad experience there (which is what prompted me to stop going for 3 months)... I brought in a sandwich from Sub Station down the street and ordered a coffee. I was at the counter eating my food and he snapped, \"Don't bring in outside food again. You know that we have sandwiches here!\" At this point, I had been going there everyday for about a year and a half and this was the first sentence he had ever said to me. Honestly, Mill Mountain just needs to shake up their culture. Their employees (and owner) need to become a bit more social. Their real saving grace is that their coffee is absolutely fantastic and that they're the only place open in the early morning hours.","type":"review","user_id":"4Nb4nr3QYwIrQHTMgz_VGQ","votes":{"cool":0,"funny":0,"useful":0}},

It was pretty busy, and probably a little dirtier than normal because of that. After getting the food, I was not impressed. The food tasted a little freezer burnt and the imitation crab had a very odd taste. With so many better options in the area I won't be going there again.","type":"review","user_id":"JQKKh5ItoBZPwZZew75-CA","votes":{"cool":0,"funny":0,"useful":0}},

Then a friend insisted I try it, raving about how great it is. It was a Friday night, and the place was almost dead (maybe it was the construction?). Looking over the menu I could see why my friend wanted me to try it. The menu was full of interesting twists on typical Mexican foods, with odd ingredients or other slight alterations in how they're prepared. The salsa that was brought out was fresh, with a slight bite, better than most in the area. So there was the good points... on to why I gave it 2 stars. The wait staff was unpleasant to a point they were almost rude. My taco sampler was disappointing, and lacking the intense and wonderful flavors the menu teased at. As other people have noted, the decor and ambiance were lacking.  I can't say I would never eat there again, because I probably will. The menu was appealing enough I want to try a couple other items before I pass final judgement.\n\nBTW, there's no mystery about cheap beer for $1.","type":"review","user_id":"JQKKh5ItoBZPwZZew75-CA","votes":{"cool":0,"funny":0,"useful":0}},

I consider Mexican my specialty both food and drink wise and have dined at many across the country. Unfortunately the Mexican food around here is too \"Americanized\" and lacks any flavor or spice. I know it's not the restaurant's fault as they serve the bland food that the majority of the customers want  but as far as I'm concerned they could do a better job. The food isn't bad but the drinks are almost undrinkable. As with my food I prefer a little more flavor out of a margarita, not just a kool-aid wannabe. It would be OK if they had some good Anejo's to sip on but most of the tequila served would be better suited to start bon fires with. \n\nIf you're looking for Mexican food it's definitely better than the Taco Bell across the street (which isn't Mexican food) but at least one Mexican restaurant around here could step up the authenticity a little bit.","type":"review","user_id":"ZR6P3FXCz8719U2oul0zkA","votes":{"cool":0,"funny":0,"useful":0}},

And then you eat there a couple of times and you realize you're starting to like it more and more each time, and you wonder if it's because it's really better than you first realized or if your standards are just getting that low.\n\nWell, if you want Japanese food, don't go here. For that matter, don't really go anywhere in Blacksburg (Blacksburg has some okay sushi, but anything else Japanese- and there's a lot more to Japanese cuisine than just sushi- be wary). But if you want something quick and meaty, with names that sound like Japanese food but have really nothing to do with the food in question, go here.\n\nEveryone raves about the Hokie sauce, which I think is something like a heavily watered down Thousand Island but I'm not entirely positive, but it's just a strange condiment to add to something that's supposed to be Japanese food. Unfortunately, the chicken (or beef) is always dried out to the point that you actually need to use the Hokie sauce just to get some kind of moisture in your food.\n\nWhat saves this place, however, is the Hokie fish. It's always cooked well and has a nice teriyaki-style glaze that just works, and you don't even need the Hokie sauce for it- it's good enough to eat on its own. Get it with broccoli and you have a pretty decent meal.\n\nI hate bashing locally owned, mom and pop places, but this place has plenty of fans, which never ceases to surprise me. I'll recommend it, but mostly for the fish, which says a lot considering we're nowhere near the ocean and I'm generally suspicious of seafood here as it is.","type":"review","user_id":"HpKwFDZw5BaWHat_4g-ufA","votes":{"cool":0,"funny":0,"useful":0}},

We actually came back a second night that week, and she sat down at our table with us and talked about what bars she goes to and how much she likes dubstep and how her Robert Miles CDs were stolen (I love Robert Miles btw). Hell, she flirted with me more than my flirty coworker did. I was about half a glass shy from asking her if she wanted to come back to my hotel room when her shift was over.\n\nBottom line: come here, eat, be merry, and chat with Harmony. Oh, and the restaurant is actually a haunted house (some lady pushed her sister down the stairs and killed her) which was converted into the restaurant. Awesome.","type":"review","user_id":"aDGpWRUP3vdVXG5aOME3BQ","votes":{"cool":2,"funny":2,"useful":2}},

The service was friendly but a little slow even though the restaurant was practically empty.  The problem arose when our pizza took over 45 minutes to arrive at our table, and upon delivery, the server (not the same server that had been waiting upon us) dropped the food off without a word, and returned to his station.  Once we picked up our pizza, the crust was very dark and tasted burnt, but was still soggy and floppy, and the cheese was not fully cooked.  I'm not sure what they did to this pie, but I'm never going back.  Neither server checked on us after this, so we did not have the opportunity to ask about a replacement pie.

The atmosphere is ecclectic or tacky, depending on how you view things.  The ceilings are low and they have installed walls/booths, which make the dining areas very cozy and quiet.\n\nWe started in the bar, which was somewhat unremarkable.  Service was very prompt and cheery and prices were very reasonable.  Expect a handful of tables and a couple of TV's.  The bartender said that the prime rib was the best ever.\n\nWe were seated in a cozy booth, which may have been a little tricky to get into if you were bigger or maybe a little arthritic.  It had the red vinyl benches noted in other reviews.  The lighting isn't bright by any means and was placed low enough to be irritating.  I kept seeing bulbs as I looked down at my meal.\n\nWhen somebody brags about having the best prime rib, you need to take them up on it.  For about $30, I received a meaty, sizeable cut of prime rib, baked potato, and side salad.  The salad was again, unremarkable, and the potato and bread were just fine.  My prime rib was very pink, so much so that it looked almost uncooked to the naked eye.  I sent it back and it quickly returned a little more done, but certainly not medium rare.  I'd rate it OK overall.  The cut had the typical fatty band around a somewhat well marbled center.  It was very slow roasted, so it was very tender, but lacked any interesting or unique flavor.  If you want the best prime rib at any price, I can unconditionally recommend the New London Steakhouse near Lynchburg, which won rave reviews by some veteran business travelers and food/wine snobs.  Overall, was very prompt and courteous.\n\nI would say that the Farmhouse is an OK restaurant, but definitely overpriced.  The waitstaff wears tuxedo shirts - but the table mats are same printed paper style found at any chain restaurant.  Prices are comparable to better chains, but quality is less than I would have expected.  The menu is also what one would expect, offering several standards with one or two quasi-unique offerings.  Certainly the ambiance doesn't warrant the extra price, so I'm struggling to find the value here.  It's not bad - it's just not good enough at one thing (quality/variety/environment) to make me want to go back.  Four business travelers racked up $180 with tips, which includes a modest compliment of drinks.\n\nBeware - if you can't wait in the bar, there doesn't appear to be much of a waiting area.\n\nIn closing, the Farmhouse won't be the best or the worst meal you ever had and presents a questionable bang for the buck.  In my opinion, it needs to get cheaper or more interesting to warrant a return visit.","type":"review","user_id":"0LP2HCv1QKyNq_z4jAgzHw","votes":{"cool":0,"funny":0,"useful":0}},

The Lover also thought it was strange that it was setup as a fine dining restaurant with bbq on the menu and microbrews on tap.\n\nThe Lover thought the food was OUTSTANDING. The baby back ribs, slow-cooked smoked wings, and the sirloin steak from Bull & Bones were the best he had ever tasted. \"They also have a couple of German-influenced dishes that appealed to his appetite and were put together very well,\" the Lover added. \n\nMost of the beers at Bull & Bones are well-crafted and very tasty, except for their All-Night Light which was disappointing, to say the least.

She explained that the server had just been cut so she would be taking care of us. Drinks took forever to get back and she was not at all friendly. It was very clear that we were a nuisance to her. Food took even longer than the drinks did - we had chicken and salmon. When the food did come, salmon was well undercooked. The bartender took it back and 5 minutes later came back okay. We were the only people dining now with a few at the bar. Only after waiting nearly 15 minutes after we had finished our meals did the bartender come by and collect the plates. Another 10 for the credit cards to be collected. Then she ran the same credit card twice. Needlessly to say I asked for the manager who asked me to get up and go to the bar to meet him. I explained how we were very unhappy we were and how we would like to not pay for such a horrible experience. Instead of being understanding, the manager explained that we could stiff on the service, but we still needed to pay for the food. After arguing some more, he threatened to call the police for us not paying. After realizing we really would not pay, he said \"Fine. Don't pay if you promise to never come back here.\" Trust me, no problem. \n\nDo not waste your time here.

Sounds like a deal to me! I deferred from our normal Roma's pizza here in the burg to try something new. Cheesey bread, wings, 2 litre, and large pepperoni, 15.38 (with 50% off coupon). What a steal! The cheesey bread was very fluffy  something I've never had before, the wings were tangy but good. The pizza was something else. The advertisement says that the dough, sauce is all made in house. Now this is a warning if you dont like, spice maybe? I enjoyed it. There was a nice tang to it, little spicy maybe it was chili's or something in the sauce, but my iron gut handled it well and enjoyed it. The wifey on the other hand, did not, and did not handle it as well. She ate one piece, then munched on the cheesey bread for the rest of the night. She thought it was the pepperoni that was too spicy, but i assured her it was the sauce. Unfortunately in a household where there is a balance of power I think she would veto any attempt at firehouse again.","type":"review","user_id":"twISWUMTq7r80UP_s11z3w","votes":{"cool":0,"funny":0,"useful":0}},

A recent trip to 622 North tells me that, at least for now, we're still waiting.\n\nArriving at 7pm, we were seated outside on the patio - a nice place to sit overlooking Main Street, for sure.  The restaurant wasn't full at the time, and we placed orders.  After an hour, the restaurant was much fuller ... but still no meals.  We were enjoying ourselves and so the delay wasn't terribly inconvenient, but we certainly wondered what was taken so long.  The server didn't have anything to offer - they don't serve table bread, and he couldn't provide any explanation.  After TWO hours, the meals finally came, and were underwhelming at best.  Everyone's asked why we stayed so long - some within our party knew others who had helped start the restaurant, and we wanted to support that.  \n\nI've heard that they weren't prepared for the \"grand opening\" that weekend, that it was slated to be a week later, but nevertheless there are some kinks to be worked out, and a menu to be tweaked.  Here's to better reviews here on out.","type":"review","user_id":"d0M3Bx5CfuCBMx4a6yFb2w","votes":{"cool":0,"funny":0,"useful":4}},

We started with some decent calamari, which had an interesting pepper batter. I ordered a steak special, and my wife got the prime rib. Not only did my steak come exactly as ordered (Pittsburgh rare), but the waitress new exactly what I meant (Glad to not get the usual blank stare). The steak was a pretty good cut of Angus and very tender. The potato mash that came with it was a little too strongly seasoned, but otherwise tasty. My wife's prime rib looked bigger than the claimed 10oz cut, and came with easily double the amount of mash potatoes that my plate had. The meat was moist and had been seasoned with an interesting spice blend. We finished off the meal with a slice of blackout cake. It was moist, and not overly sweetened, with just a thin layer of frosting. It was good, but nothing to rave about. Actually, that pretty much sums the place up.

I'm sure that some of the delicious sounding pizzas on the menu are good... except the one I attempted to eat with my ladyfriend.  I ordered the Bella Vista, which initially sounded interesting: \"thinly sliced potatoes topped with extra virgin olive oil, fresh garlic, fresh rosemary, coarse black pepper.\"  The order also consisted of salad and cannolis.  The salad dressing was off.  It was supposed to be balsamic vinagrette, but tasted like Kraft fat free Italian.  The pizza - which I should note doesn't have cheese (though I thought it would) - tasted like a disc of dry, hard, stale dough with no salt, oil, or other seasonings (that I could discern), no garlic (as the description stated), and the potatoes were affixed sparingly and served only to dry out the dough-disc further.\n\nNote: the cannolis were good.\n\nIt's worth mentioning, at this point, that I cannot remember the last time I complained about food.  It was not my experience with Ceritano's food as such that compelled me to write this review; rather, it was the subsequent interaction I had with the manager of the restaurant that obliged me to so write.  My ladyfriend and I couldn't even eat beyond a bite each of the entire pizza. We ended up ordering from another pizza place in town for delivery, as Ceritano's was closed by this point.  \n\nThe next day, I called the restaurant to let them know about the food we attempted to eat, and to see if I might be able to get my money back (the pizza alone was $14.95). I don't remember the name of the fellow I spoke with, but he was surely the rudest service industry worker I've had contact with in many years.  When I explained to him how we weren't able to eat the pizza, he effectively blamed me for ordering 'the wrong thing.'  I was told that the pizza was \"for vegans\" ... it \"says so on the menu\" (note: it doesn't say this anywhere on the online menu).  \"Are you a vegan?\" he asked.  \"No,\" I replied.  \"Well that's why you don't like it...\" he said.  After not listening to me tell him about his own product for several minutes, and after hearing about how this situation was entirely my fault, he finally asked \"what do you want?\" as though this was not entirely obvious by now.  He said he would make me another pizza (note: this conversation is taking place the day after the incident, since the restaurant was closed by the time we ate), but I wasn't interested in this since we had already ordered a pizza from another restaurant the night before.  I asked if it would be possible to get a coupon, credit, or anything that we could use at a later time and he said 'no'.  The last thing he did was ridicule me for having to discuss the matter further with my ladyfriend.  Suffice it to say, because of this, we'll not be going back; and further, we encourage others not to patronize this restaurant.","type":"review","user_id":"rfRBWLSbm7DHShjQTKk3ug","votes":{"cool":0,"funny":1,"useful":1}},

Drum roll......\n\nThis time, we were joined by some of our awesome friends. And from last time's experience, we weren't expecting a lot. Well, we were definitely proven wrong. Cabo fired back... with authority.\n\nFor starters, our friend Kat had gotten the Veggie Roll and was kind enough to let me taste it.  One word: Glorious. It is portabella and wild mushrooms, yellow squash, zucchini, and the usual works. It was presented in sushi style (bigger portions) topped with tequila lime aioli. This was also served with salad on the side. \n\nI had requested to have a sample of their Soy Ginger Shrimp Taco and the Tavarua Tuna Taco. The soy ginger taco came with beer battered shrimps that were tossed in a soy ginger glaze, stuffed with cabbage, tomato, avocado, monterey jack and cheddar cheese topped altogether with sesame seeds to taste. The shrimp were juicy and plump; tasty and savory good. The Tavarua Tuna Taco was delightfully fresh; definitely not dry this time around. You can taste all the ingredients well and how they complemented each other on your palate. To pair, I had a glass of their sparkling, potable Cabo water. \n\nThe Lover is not as adventurous and as random as I am. He ordered the Carne Asada Steak Burrito again. This time it was not disappointing for he devoured that thing in 2 minutes --- the whole thing! Good? I'd say it was a lot better than the first one. (Beer pairing to be posted soon.. The Lover isn't here and I can't remember for the life of me what it was he drank that night). \n\nThe tortillas were fresh.

The eggs are never dry or clumpy, the potatoes are usually perfectly tender and crispy on the outside, and the spicing can vary from medium to salty. Other varieties such as Chappie's Choice (cheese but no salsa) are similarly excellent. The tofu scramble is another good breakfast option. It's an enormous pile of tofu baked in a barbecue-style sauce. Lunches are also very good. My standard is the tofu reuben, although the specials are usually imaginative and tasty, too.

I think the menu is great - it's SoCal-influenced fare (NOT Mexican) and is unlike anything you can find in Blacksburg or anywhere nearby.  The fish tacos are delicious, especially the BBQ Mahi tacos, as are the tuna stacks and most of the burritos (Wasabi Tuna was my favorite while I was there).  \n\nThere's only one caveat to the food, I think: it depends on who prepares your food.  This is probably true with any restaurant in a college town, but I've had some very good food here, and some food that really let me down, and I can always tell when it's someone who likes to cook and does it well, versus some schmuck just trying to make a dollar and doesn't care about the end product.  The usual giveaway: the temperature and consistency of the taco shell.  It should be warm and crispy, yet pliable.\n\nAs far as the bar is concerned, you'll probably end up drinking with a number of regulars/locals/employees.  Cabo has the best margaritas in the area, quality-wise (El Rodeo will give you the best bang for your buck with the Texas Jumbo Margarita), and if tequila is your thing, you'll be right at home.  Cabo offers every tequila available through the ABC in Virginia; last time I checked, that was 72 different tequilas.  If you finish them all (over time), you'll get your name on a plaque, and maybe even a t-shirt or something.\n\nParking can be a pain in the ass, but there is a parking garage over in Kent Square if you need a spot.  You run the risk of being towed if you park at the Bookstore across the street.  \n\nAll in all, Cabo's definitely a nice change of pace from the normal Blacksburg restaurant and bar.  I'd definitely recommend giving it a try.","type":"review","user_id":"Brzyv0JlzxG3PFMXq085KA","votes":{"cool":1,"funny":0,"useful":1}},

FALSE.\n\nThe sushi here is pretty standard for what you get from a to go style sushi place but, that being said, it holds up pretty well against similar establishments in NYC and SF that I have frequented. There are two key components of any sushi experience. The obvious one, the fish, is always a little limited by the less expensive, to go style of sushi served here. The game changer is the rice. The quality of the rice preparation separates good to go sushi places from only so-so ones. They do a really good job with the rice prep here (as opposed to the mushy rice that you get in Kroger rolls) and the rolls are well made.\n\nBest price + quality ratio for sushi in Blacksburg.\n\nOh, and the decor is really adorable.","type":"review","user_id":"Of1gS4IfNhszA8tn6KNLXQ","votes":{"cool":0,"funny":0,"useful":0}},

I really feel for the young college students who serve as wait staff and have to put up with a completely inept kitchen. We waited nearly an hour to receive two dishes. I really wish the food was worth the wait, calamari was sub-par and the mahi mahi burrito was drenched in a mayonnaise based sauce that smacked of laziness on the part of the cooking staff that prides itself on \"fresh ingredients\". \n\nTo make matters worse, the dinner did not sit well... so I think I am being generous giving Cabo Fish Taco two stars.

They have live music there during the week. They have a little area called the \"Champagne Room\" that's a bit more private, if you can manage to get it. Downstairs is the tavern area, where people go to have drinks and food in a more adult and casual setting. I usually go downstairs at night and upstairs during the day. They card in the tavern area later on during the night. They have a big TV downstairs where they play sports. The once smokey atmosphere is now gone as well, which is very nice.\n\nBeer and specials - They have a long list of beers to choose from and a recently opened section where they sell local microbrews. I have yet to check it out but I've heard good things.\nWeekdays 6-7pm is Hammertime where you get half off beers, on Sundays they have deals on imported beers. You can also do the \"Luck of the Draw\" where you pay a dollar for a random beer of their choosing. I've usually gotten stuff on the lower end of things, but its pretty fun to do and it's only a buck!\n\nDrinks - Their drinks are always good, not watered down and weak like in most places downtown. Definitely worth going for drinks alone.\n\nFood - Always great. I usually get the pita pizza which is a create your own pizza (you choose 3 ingredients) and is an awesome buy for around 5 bucks. They totally fill you up or make for yummy leftovers. I've also tried their sandwiches and subs, always come out good and fill you up. Their appetizers are also delicious - the hummus, spinach and artichoke dips, and their spanakopita's are great.\n\nService - The one thing they're not great at is service, although they have greatly improved since I started going there. You can expect to wait a bit, especially if you're downstairs. You can also take it upon yourself to head to the bar and order if you're feeling antsy and want your stuff sooner. Upstairs they tend to come around more often.\n\nBottom line - Definitely check them out if you're in the 'burg - it would be a sin not to!","type":"review","user_id":"-k2jA8vZus1itFdn4bh5Vw","votes":{"cool":0,"funny":1,"useful":1}},

The servers were friendly, the music was good, and the food was good as well!\n\nWe ordered gyros, souvlaki (to see what it was) and the curly fries.  \n\nThe gyros were very good - the meat wasn't too crisp or too soft, and the cucumber sauce is really good.  The pita bread is also very good - the perfect temperature and texture.  \nThe souvlaki is marinated pork tenderloin, and it was also very good.  It's a little juicier than the gyro, but otherwise almost the same dish.  \nThe curly fries are good to order to share - they're perfectly golden and crisp, and taste delicious.  Everything tasted good!\n\nMy only qualm with this place is the size of the portions, but for the price, it's about right.  It's affordable for college kids, and it's a good late dinner if you're wandering by around 9 or 10 (it closes at 11PM Monday - Saturday, and 10PM on Sunday).

The Firehouse brand had made a good impression on me with their subs and then their pizza adverts. Unfortunately, there were a few problems with their pizza division.\n\nFirstly, even after 35% off through the website, you end up paying more than if you call in an order for a large specialty pizza. That's just weird to me. \n\nSecondly, I was being charged $18 for a large specialty and 2 marinara. The guy taking my order was very kind though and corrected his error when I pointed out that my large specialty should only be 10.99 + 1.00 for the marinara. He quickly corrected it to 12.04. I'm not sure how the math works there but I'm pretty sure it's wrong. Anyway, from the few reviews here, it does seem like the whole pricing+ coupons thing desperately needs to be paid some attention.\n\nAnd finally...the pizza...I could have overlooked the aforementioned circumstance as my food was in fact delivered promptly and the service was courteous. However, I ordered the Firehouse Pizza and it was pretty subpar. The crust was tough and bland and the sauce wasn't flavorful at all. The toppings they used, however, seemed fresh and I appreciated that.\n\nUnfortunately, I won't be ordering here until I hear they've revamped their pizza (owners re: we want to like your pizzeria!)

There is no real separation of duties, so most of the time everyone in there is running around like a headless chicken. Some of the employees are friendly enough. This doesn't include, however, the owner himself. He generally stands behind the counter leering at customers and employees and may be most unfriendly coffee shop owner I've ever had the displeasure of dealing with.

The \"house\" is divided into 3 main area's - main restaurant, wine/beer bar and a regular bar with pool tables/tv's/etc (which is seperated for noise purposes).  They have a piano player that sits in the main dining area that can also be heard in the wine bar.\nI have been to the wine bar on 2 different occasions and both have been very good experiences.  Within the wine bar, they have booths, tables as well as a few leather couches/chairs.\nThe service is very good.  The hostess was very nice and explained their layout and then took me to the requested wine bar area.  Both times i have sat in the leather sofa section.  Not only did the server check on me quite often, the hostess came by on occasion to make sure everything was all right.\nFor food, i have only had the appitizers.  I have had the spinach artichoke dip and the buffalo chicken flatbread pizza.  Both were really good and seemed very fresh.  I have seen entree's ordered within the wine bar area and they have each looked very good as well.\nThe wine list has lots of whites and reds to choose from.  The hostess mentioned that they have a few staples but they also rotate the list quite often.  The wines are priced very fair which allows you to venture out and try different styles.\nOverall, i rate this a great experience in Blacksburg.

The Mahi Mahi was very dry and the ingredients were incredibly boring. Also, romaine lettuce at a Mexican restaurant?? Just kinda weird.

After we ordered, it was about another hour before the food came, albeit the server had to admit one order did not come out because he dropped the pizza on the floor...  I realize that this is a hangout joint, but really, do you have the time to \"hangout\" there for four-five hours on a Friday night?  I'd rather be somewhere where the waiters don't constantly, clumsily bump into you and/or your chair; where the place doesn't reek like cigarette smoke; where the floors weren't so greasy that the waiters actually slipped around like a slip and slide.  This place was dark and dingy.  If that is \"adult,\" I'd rather go to any of the other many restaurants lining that same road.  \n\nThe food - wasn't much better than the ambience of the place.  I got the \"Mad Greek.\"  I wonder if it would be better if it were the \"Happy Greek.\"  The meat (all 3 thin slices) was extremely dry; the yogurt sauce was like tart mayonnaise water, and everything else was basically filler to make you feel like you got your money's worth.  Two surprising notes, which saved this place form the one star - the bread for the sandwich was good.  Good yeast was used in the preparation and it was very moist on the inside and light and crunchy on the outside.

Selections on the lunch buffet change daily, and there is quick turnover on the buffet, so the food is always fresh.  \n\nThe pizza is a thin crust, New York style pie that holds up quite nicely even though it's on a buffet and under the heat lamps.  The pizza really is excellent- nice and chewy, quite savory.  The salad bar is adequate; the iceberg lettuce is rather un-spectacular, but the homemade Italian dressing and homemade sun dried tomato dressings are pretty good.  As for pasta, the buffet included a spaghetti with garlic and oil, cheese tortellini with alfredo sauce, meatballs, and chicken cacciatore.  The pasta was okay, but probably something that you could cook for yourself at home.  The buffet also includes garlic knots, which might be reason enough to eat at the restaurant, and chicken wings.  \n\nThe service was quick and friendly, and the restaurant has a nice ambiance.  Mamma Concetta's is good for a quick lunch, but I would also come here for dinner.

Typically, this is not a good thing as restaurants that offer different ethnic cuisines (Chinese, Japanese, Thai and a little Korean in China Inn's case) rarely ever do any of them even remotely well. BUT this is a welcome addition to the restaurants in Blacksburg since there's little variety in dining compared to other, more busy college towns.\n\nI ordered delivery from them today, and got the shrimp and vegetable tempura appetizer, the teriyaki chicken, and the pan-fried gyoza. Everything was decent and tasted fine. The tempura and gyoza was soggy but this had probably a lot to do with the fact it was delivery. The chicken teriyaki tasted all right, if a little dry. But it had a teriyaki flavor to it, and it was completely edible and even a little enjoyable- I liked the abundance of onions and broccoli that gave the dish a little more of a kick.\n\nStill, my standards for Blacksburg restaurants is that if it's not bland, if it at least tries to approximate the basic flavors of the cuisine they're trying to mimic (Boudreaux's for cajun fare has failed at this many, many times), I'm happy. Do I still miss restaurants back home in California? Yup. Can I survive here if I have a place like China Inn to order delivery from? Sure.

It wasn't even all white meat, and it just did not have the right textures. The sauce wasn't spicy enough to qualify as General Tso's either, that's the whole point, otherwise it's just sesame chicken without the sesame seeds.

I always find this to be an oxymoron.   However, I am glad that Gillie's also does fish because it fits.  I've mainly gone for breakfasts, but I know their lunches are also super yummy. \n\nGillie's makes everything fresh so they remind you that your food might take some time to prepare.  Also, they run out of the fresh squeezed orange juice pretty fast during a weekend morning.  On top of that, it's a small place, so you might have to wait a little while for a table.  Luckily, the food is usually worth waiting for. \n\nThe food is fresh... most breakfast dishes are served with their form of potatoes (kind of spicy home fries that are super yummy) and a biscuit (much to my horror because I hate biscuits).  I know people that would kill for the french toast (made with either baguette or whole grain bread) but I prefer their omelets.  They are made with three eggs and automatically come with white cheddar on them.  Yesterday, I had what sounds like a dangerous combination but turned out to be the best omelet I've ever eaten: feta, fresh spinach, artichoke hearts, and smoked salmon.\n\nThey also own Bollo's coffee shop, around the corner, and the two share a bakery.

If your main goal in a bar is to guzzle as much bud lite in for as cheap as possible, this is also not the place for you. \n\nThe real star at the Cellar is BEER. It's a place for people who love good beer, and their wine list is growing too. They have a huge draft list with lots of artisan/craft domestics along with imports. It used to be the best place to get New River Pale Ale draft (RIP) :(\n\nUpstairs at the Cellar on a week-night can be a nice place to have a conversation, plus live music several nights a week. Downstairs is always smoky, crowded, noisy, but wonderfully cozy. When you keep running into your art/art history professors down there, you know you're in the right place. \n\nAround Hammertime, the place gets packed. If you were thinking about eating during hammertime, you are wrong. Just getting a pitcher might take 20 min. It's worth it if you get their early and snag a table for your group of friends. You can get a large pitcher for $6 of something that might normally cost $10 or $12. \n\nA whole lot of the entrees and pastas are pre-frozen, nothing special. Don't bother with having them de-frost a piece of cheesecake for you either. Pizzas are pretty good, try the Mexican or the Cellar House Special pizza. Subs, meh. Pita and French Bread pizzas are a great deal, and tons of food. \n\nAside from recent arrivals like Cafe de Bangkok, the Cellar is as close to \"real people\" (aka, not a bunch of stupid frat guys) as Blacksburg gets.","type":"review","user_id":"b2O7aFjK48rFHdBIQYVM1w","votes":{"cool":0,"funny":0,"useful":0}},

The chicken was still sizzling hot when it got to me and the veggies were a nice touch too.  The sauce made everything ten times better. \n\nI also tried the Chicken Curry along with the side Naan bread, too.  The Chicken Curry was very flavorful, however, I do recommend more rice because it was a bit spicy!  The Naan bread was delicious.  It had a light taste and was a little bit crispy.\n\nThe staff was really nice.  One of the waiters thought I was Indian, but I told him that I was Filipina, and then he said a couple words in Tagalog (Philippine dialect) to me.  I thought that was pretty cool.\n\nIn addition, for dinner, they had some musicians that played some pretty good tunes that sounded beautiful.

I travel all the time, have eaten enough sushi in both japan and every major city in the us to know what great sushi can be- this isn't that- buy it is a few notches above anything in a 20 mile radius of Blacksburg -  if you care about non-questionable hamachi, tuna, salmon, albacore, etc. That said, in the last few years since the owners brother left the sushi bar,  portions, quality, and creativity have gone down substantially - but it still gets best in the area for consistent fish quality. I have eaten here about 50 times since they opened.\n     I have  tried my best to eat what they call sushi at the more recent local contenders in Blacksburg and it is usually a disappointing experience.  \nAlso - their ginger dressing is excellent and should be bottled and sold.

Literally just got done eating the Spinach and bacon burger, which had a very mild herbed goat-cheese and some caramelized onions on it. It's also served on some crusty, toasted sourdough bread. That was a seriously good burger!! The boyfriend had what I guess was their special burger of the day, which was the Chipotle BBQ Pork burger, and although I'm not a fan of blue-cheese I took a bite anyway and it was super-delicious!!! \n\nWe also decided to be fat kids and got dessert. I got their Cranberry-Walnut chocolate chip pie and OH MY GOD!!!! You realllllly need to try that. Randy got the Bourbon Pecan Pie, which was good..... buuuuuut.... mine was better. They make their own desserts and I really hope they make their pie crusts too because it was amazingly buttery, flaky and delicious. If they don't make their crusts I don't want to know. Just let me keep thinking they do.\n\nWhile we were ordering our food (to go) we looked over their extensive beer and wine lists (but mostly the beer) and they have a great selection! Lagunita's, Bell's, and other craft beers! \n\nThe service was good, too, I have to add! (Mostly because I'm a server)\n\nThe only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because all the toppings of the burger were on the bottom and I felt that it made the foundation (bun/bread, etc) kind of soggy. But definitely give this place a go!!! I highly recommend it!!","type":"review","user_id":"0nvDxcmlbaNTBV4XC6QCzg","votes":{"cool":1,"funny":0,"useful":0}},

A little expensive if you get a drink, too, but the discount punch card helps a bit if you go a lot like I do.  Tons of drink variety, though I've only tried the matcha, original, and taro bubble milk teas, which are all good. I love their crepes--they are a perfect size for lunch, and are a well-balanced meal (I usually add extra lettuce or corn for added nutrition.). Nice magazine selection for reading, and free Wifi. Decor is fun and modern--bright orange and white with natural wood.  The only downside is no exterior windows due to mall location.","type":"review","user_id":"NSHURcUpyOqKC4X8CIlxNQ","votes":{"cool":0,"funny":0,"useful":0}}]
